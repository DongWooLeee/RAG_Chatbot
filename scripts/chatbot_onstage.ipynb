Though the number of stocks in the open market is fixed, the con\\x02stituents of the market change over time as each company’s rank by its market capitalization\\r\\nfluctuates. When one is allowed to invest also in money market, the open market resembles\\r\\nthe entire ‘closed’ equity market in the sense that the equivalence of market viability (lack of\\r\\narbitrage) and the existence of num´eraire portfolio (portfolio which cannot be outperformed)\\r\\nholds. When the access to the money market is prohibited, some topics such as Capital Asset\\r\\nPricing Model (CAPM), construction of functionally-generated portfolios, and the concept\\r\\nof universal portfolio are presented in open market setting.\\r\\n1 Introduction\\r\\nEquity markets are conventionally assumed to be closed, in the sense that they are almost\\r\\nuniversally assumed to consist of a given, fixed number of stocks at all times. However, this\\r\\nassumption fails to represent most real markets, where new stocks enter and some others exit\\r\\ndue to privatization, bankruptcy, or simply bad luck.\\r\\nThe number of companies in the U.S. stock market has undergone wide fluctuations. In\\r\\n1975, there were around 4,800 U.S. domiciled firms listed on the NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq.\\r\\nThis number reached a peak of 7,500 listed firms in 1997, and then decreased by more than half\\r\\nto 3,600 firms 20 years later in 2017.\\r\\nTo mitigate the assumption of a fixed, immutable collection of companies, and to model\\r\\nstock markets more realistically, we study here markets that are open. These are constructed by\\r\\nrestricting our ‘investing space’ from the entire market to the subset composed of a certain fixed\\r\\nnumber n of top-capitalization stocks. More precisely, within the entire stock market, we keep\\r\\ntrack of the price dynamics of all stocks, rank them by order of market capitalization, consider\\r\\nan open market consisting of the top n stocks, and only invest in stocks that belong to this open\\r\\nmarket. High-capitalization indexes, such as the S&P 500 index, where one invests only in the\\r\\nn = 500 highest-capitalization companies, and any given stock is replaced by another one when\\r\\nits capitalization falls, are of this type.\\r\\nIn this paper, we present some results from closed markets which remain valid also in open\\r\\nmarkets. The main result of this type involves the concept of “market viability”, which is\\r\\n∗Department of Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 (E-mail: dk2571@columbia.edu).\\r\\n1\\nunderstood as “lack of a certain egregious form of arbitrage”, the condition which prohibits\\r\\nfinancing non-trivial liabilities starting from arbitrarily small initial capital. The result shows\\r\\nthat in an open stock market, with an access to the money market, viability is equivalent to\\r\\nany one of the following conditions: (i) a portfolio with the local martingale num´eraire property\\r\\nexists; (ii) a local martingale deflator exists; (iii) the market has locally finite maximal growth;\\r\\n(iv) a growth-optimal portfolio exists; and (v) a portfolio with the log-optimality property exists.\\r\\nWe provide precise definitions for these terms, and show that this equivalence can be formulated\\r\\nin terms of the drifts and covariations of the underlying stock prices, modeled by continuous\\r\\nsemimartingales.\\r\\nWhen the access to the money market is forbidden and one can only allowed to invest in\\r\\nfixed number n of top-capitalization stocks, the class of eligible portfolios diminishes significantly\\r\\nas portfolios must satisfy ‘self-financing’ condition. Under this extra condition, we provide a\\r\\nconnection of the above viability theory to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), develop\\r\\na way for constructing functionally-generated portfolios, and discuss universal portfolio in an\\r\\nopen market.\\r\\nPreview : Section 2 defines open markets, investment strategies, and portfolios, as well as other\\r\\nnotions which will be needed throughout this paper. Section 3 develops arbitrage theory in open\\r\\nmarkets, along with the concepts of market viability and num´eraire. We provide definitions and\\r\\nproperties for these concepts, then state and prove the main result. Section 4 explores stock\\r\\nportfolios, CAPM theory, functional generation of portfolios, and universal portfolio in open\\r\\nmarkets. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.\\r\\n2 Portfolios in Open Markets\\r\\nLet us suppose that the “whole equity market universe” is composed of N stocks and that we are\\r\\nonly interested in investing in the top n largest capitalization stocks, for some fixed 1 ≤ n < N.\\r\\nFor example, when our investing universe is the entire U.S. stock market, by setting n = 500\\r\\nwe are investing in those large companies which form the S&P 500 index. In order to invest in\\r\\nthese top n stocks, we must keep track of the rank of each stock’s capitalization at all times,\\r\\nand put together a portfolio composed of the n stocks with the largest capitalizations.\\r\\nThroughout this paper, we fix two positive integers n and N satisfying 1 ≤ n < N as above.\\r\\nWe suppose that trading is continuous in time, with no transaction costs or taxes, and that\\r\\nshares are infinitely divisible. We also assume without loss of generality that each stock has a\\r\\nsingle share outstanding, and the price of a stock is equal to its capitalization; thus, we use the\\r\\nterms ‘price of stock’ and ‘capitalization of stock’ interchangeably. We also assume that stock\\r\\nprices are discounted by the money market, and adopt the convention that the money market\\r\\npays and charges zero interest.\\r\\n2.1 Stock prices and their ranks\\r\\nWe first present the following definition of price process in the market described above.\\r\\nDefinition 2.1 (Price process). For an N-dimensional vector S ≡ (S1, · · · , Sn, · · · , SN ) of\\r\\ncontinuous semimartingales on a filtered probability space (Ω, F, F(·), P), we call S a vector of\\r\\nprice processes if each component is strictly positive, i.e., the inequalities Si(t) > 0 hold for all\\r\\n2\\ni ∈ {1, · · · , N} at any time t ≥ 0. The component processes of S represent the stock prices, or\\r\\nthe capitalizations, of N companies.\\r\\nWe need now to clarify some notation regarding ranks. Given the vector S of price processes,\\r\\nwe define the k-th ranked process S(k)(·) of S1, · · · , SN by\\r\\nS(k)(·) := max\\r\\n1≤i1<···<ik≤N\\r\\nmin{Si1(·), · · · , Sik(·)}. (2.1)\\r\\nTo be more specific, for any t ≥ 0, we have\\r\\nmax\\r\\ni=1,··· ,N\\r\\nSi(t) = S(1)(t) ≥ S(2)(t) ≥ · · · ≥ S(N−1)(t) ≥ S(N)(t) = min\\r\\ni=1,··· ,N\\r\\nSi(t); (2.2)\\r\\nthat is, we rank the components of the vector process S = (S1, · · · , SN ) in descending order,\\r\\nwith the lexicographic rule for breaking ties that always assigns a higher rank (i.e., a smaller\\r\\n(k)) to the smallest index i.\\r\\nDefinition 2.2 (Price process by rank). For the vector S of price processes in Definition 2.1,\\r\\nwe call the N-dimensional vector process\\r\\nS(t) ≡\\r\\n\\r\\nS(1)(t), · · · , S(N)(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n, t ≥ 0 (2.3)\\r\\nwhere each component is defined via (2.1), the vector of price processes by rank. In particular,\\r\\nthe k-th component Sk(t) = S(k)(t) of the vector S(t) represents the price of k-th ranked stock\\r\\namong N companies at time t.\\r\\nEach component of the vector process S(·) is also a continuous semimartingale, from the\\r\\nresults in Banner and Ghomrasni (2008). Along with the notation (2.1), we define a process\\r\\n{1, · · · , N} × [0,∞) ∋ (i, t) 7→ ui(t) ∈ {1, · · · , N}, such that each ui(·) is predictable and\\r\\nsatisfies\\r\\nSi(t) = S\\r\\n\\r\\nui(t)\\r\\n\\x01(t), ∀ t ≥ 0, (2.4)\\r\\nfor every i = 1, · · · , N. In other words, ui(t) is the rank of the i-th stock Si(t) at time t, for\\r\\nany given index i = 1, · · · , N. Note that for every fixed t ≥ 0, the function u·(t) : {1, · · · , N} →\\r\\n{1, · · · , N} is a bijection, because we break ties using the lexicographic rule when defining (2.1).\\r\\n2.2 Cumulative return processes\\r\\nIn this subsection, we present the notion of cumulative returns of the market. We first define\\r\\nthe stochastic logarithm L(Y ) of a positive continuous semimartingale Y with Y (0) = 1 by\\r\\nL(Y ) := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\ndY (t)\\r\\nY (t)\\r\\n(2.5)\\r\\nand consider the vector R ≡ (R1, · · · , RN ), whose every component is the stochastic logarithm\\r\\nof the corresponding normalized component of S in Definition 2.1:\\r\\nRi:= L\\r\\n\\x12\\r\\nSi\\r\\nSi(0)\\x13\\r\\n, i = 1, · · · , N. (2.6)\\r\\n3\\nEach component process Ri\\r\\nis again a semimartingale, and represents the cumulative returns of\\r\\nthe i-th stock, since its dynamic is represented as\\r\\ndRi(t) = dSi(t)\\r\\nSi(t)\\r\\n, t ≥ 0, and Ri(0) = 0 for i = 1, · · · , N. (2.7)\\r\\nWe posit the semimartingale decomposition\\r\\nRi = Ai + Mi, i = 1, · · · , N, (2.8)\\r\\nfor each component of the vector R = (R1, · · · , RN ). Here, the component Ai of the vector\\r\\nprocess A ≡ (A1, · · · , AN ) with Ai(0) = 0 is adapted, continuous and of finite variation on\\r\\ncompact time intervals; whereas each component Mi of the vector process M ≡ (M1, · · · , MN )\\r\\nis a continuous local martingale with Mi(0) = 0, for i = 1, · · · , N. We think of the finite\\r\\nvariation processes Ai as the ‘drift components’, and of the local martinagles Mi as the ‘noise\\r\\ncomponents’, of R.\\r\\nWe define next the continuous, nondecreasing scalar process\\r\\nO := X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n\\x12 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n|dAi(t)| + d[Mi, Mi](t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n, (2.9)\\r\\nwhere R T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|dAi(t)| denotes the total variation of Ai on the interval [0, T] for T ≥ 0 and [Mi, Mj ]\\r\\nrepresents the covariation process of the continuous semimartingales Mi and Mj for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.\\r\\nHere, we note that [Ri, Rj ] = [Mi, Mj ] holds from (2.8). This scalar process O plays the role\\r\\nof an “operational clock” for the vector R. All processes Ai and [Mi, Mj ] for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N are\\r\\nabsolutely continuous with respect to this clock, and thus, by the Radon-Nikod´ym Theorem,\\r\\nthere exist two predictable processes\\r\\nα ≡ (αi)1≤i≤N and c ≡ (ci,j )1≤i,j≤N , (2.10)\\r\\nvector-valued and matrix-valued, respectively, such that\\r\\nA =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nα(t)dO(t), and C ≡ [M, M] = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nc(t)dO(t). (2.11)\\r\\nHere and in what follows, we write C ≡ (Ci,j )1≤i,j≤N for the nonnegative-definite, matrix-valued\\r\\nprocess of covariations\\r\\nCi,j := [Mi, Mj ] = [Ri, Rj ], for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. (2.12)\\r\\nThe component αiin (2.10) represents the local rate of return of the i-th stock in the market;\\r\\nwhereas the entry ci,j stands for the local covariation rate of the i-th and j-th stocks. We call\\r\\nthe collection of local rates α, c in (2.10) the local characteristics of the market, and these rates\\r\\nare measured with respect to the operational clock O in (2.9).\\r\\nFor a continuous vector-valued semimartingale Y = (Y1, · · · , YN ), we denote by I(Y ) the\\r\\nclass of predictable vector processes π = (π1, · · · , πN ) which are integrable with respect to the\\r\\nvector Y . In particular, for the collection I(R) of the vector R in (2.6) and (2.8), we have a very\\r\\n4\\nconvenient characterization: A predictable vector process π = (π1, · · · , πN ) belongs to I(R), if\\r\\nand only if\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\n|π\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)α(t)| + π\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)c(t)π(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\ndO(t) < ∞, for any T ≥ 0. (2.13)\\r\\nWe denote then by\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t) ≡\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dR(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dA(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dM(t),\\r\\nthe stochastic integral of π ∈ I(R), with respect to the vector semimartingale R.\\r\\n2.3 Investment strategies and portfolios\\r\\nAlong with the N-dimensional vector S of Definition 2.1, representing the stock prices of the\\r\\nmarket, we introduce the following notions.\\r\\nDefinition 2.3 (Investment strategy, wealth process, and num´eraire). We call an N-dimensional\\r\\nvector of predictable process ϑ ≡ (ϑ1, · · · , ϑN ) investment strategy, if it is integrable with respect\\r\\nto the price vector S, i.e., ϑ ∈ I(S). For any nonnegative real number x, we call\\r\\nX(·; x, ϑ) := x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϑ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dS(t) ≡ x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t) (2.14)\\r\\nthe wealth process generated by ϑ with initial capital x. We call the wealth process num´eraire,\\r\\nif X(·; 1, ϑ) > 0 holds for the normalized initial capital x = 1. The collection of all num´eraires\\r\\nis denoted by X .\\r\\nThe i-th component ϑi(t) represents the units of investment (or number of shares) held in\\r\\nthe i-th stock at time t, and plays the role of integrand with integrator dSi(t) in the stochastic\\r\\nintegral of (2.14). The requirement X(0) = x = 1 in defining num´eraires is a simple normaliza\\x02tion, because X(·; cx, cϑ) = cX(·; x, ϑ) holds for any positive real number c. Since we consider\\r\\ninvestment only in the top n stocks, we need a similar definition of investment strategy for this\\r\\nparticular case.\\r\\nDefinition 2.4 (Investment strategy among the top n stocks). We call an investment strategy\\r\\nϑ ∈ I(S) an investment strategy among the top n stocks, if the “sensoring” equalities\\r\\nϑi(t)1{ui(t)>n} = 0, for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0, (2.15)\\r\\nhold with the notation (2.4).\\r\\nThe wealth process and the num´eraire associated with this investment strategy ϑ among the\\r\\ntop n stocks, are defined in the same manner as in Definition 2.3. We denote the collection of N\\x02dimensional predictable processes ϑ satisfying the condition (2.15) by T (n), and the collection\\r\\nof investment strategies among the top n stocks by I(S) ∩ T (n).\\r\\nThe collection of all num´eraires generated by investment strategies ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) among\\r\\nthe top n stocks is denoted by X n.\\r\\n5\\nThe condition (2.15) prohibits the strategy ϑ from investing in the i-th stock at time t ≥ 0,\\r\\nif this stock fails to rank at that time among the top n stocks in terms of capitalization. We\\r\\npresent another definition, that of a portfolio rule, which plays the role of integrand with respect\\r\\nto the integrator dRi(t) of (2.6).\\r\\nDefinition 2.5 (Portfolio). We call an N-dimensional predictable, vector-valued process π ≡\\r\\n(π1, · · · , πN ) ∈ I(R) a portfolio, if it is integrable with respect to the cumulative return vector\\r\\nR of (2.6). We call a portfolio π ∈ I(R) a portfolio among the top n stocks, if the equalities\\r\\nπi(t)1{ui(t)>n} = 0, for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0, (2.16)\\r\\nhold with the notation (2.4). We denote the collection of portfolios among the top n stocks by\\r\\nI(R) ∩ T (n).\\r\\nSince the function u·(t) : {1, · · · , N} → {1, · · · , N} is bijective for every t ≥ 0, the collection\\r\\n\\x08\\r\\n1{ui(t)=k}\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nk=1,···,N constitutes a partition of unity for any given i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0, and the\\r\\nconditions (2.15), (2.16) can also be formulated respectively as\\r\\nϑi(t) = Xn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nϑi(t)1{ui (t)=k} = ϑi(t)1{ui(t)≤n}, for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0, (2.17)\\r\\nπi(t) = Xn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nπi(t)1{ui (t)=k} = πi(t)1{ui(t)≤n}, for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0. (2.18)\\r\\nWe present next the connection between investment strategies ϑ and portfolios π. For any\\r\\nscalar continuous semimartingale Z with Z(0) = 0, we denote the stochastic exponential of Z\\r\\nby\\r\\nE(Z) := exp \\x10Z −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n[Z, Z]\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n. (2.19)\\r\\nIt can be shown that this is also the unique process satisfying the linear stochastic integral\\r\\nequation\\r\\nE(Z) = 1 + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nE(Z)(t)dZ(t). (2.20)\\r\\nIt is straightforward to check that the stochastic logarithm operator L(·) in (2.5), is the inverse\\r\\nof the stochastic exponential operator E(·) in (2.19).\\r\\nWe introduce now the cumulative returns process of a portfolio π as in Definition 2.5, via\\r\\nthe vector stochastic integral\\r\\nRπ := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dR(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t), (2.21)\\r\\nand consider its stochastic exponential\\r\\nXπ := E(Rπ) = E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n. (2.22)\\r\\n6\\nIn particular, we note that Xπ is positive. Then, from (2.22), (2.21), and (2.7), we obtain the\\r\\ndynamics\\r\\ndXπ(t)\\r\\nXπ(t)\\r\\n= dRπ(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)\\r\\ndSi(t)\\r\\nSi(t)\\r\\n, Xπ(0) = 1. (2.23)\\r\\nBy setting\\r\\nϑi:=\\r\\nXππi\\r\\nSi\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N, (2.24)\\r\\nwe arrive at the equation (2.14) with X(·; 1, ϑ) replaced by Xπ(·). Thus, from the portfolio\\r\\nπ ∈ I(R), we can obtain the corresponding investment strategy ϑ and its num´eraire X(·; 1, ϑ), via\\r\\nthe recipe (2.24). Here, we denote the num´eraire generated by the portfolio π by X(·; 1, ϑ) := Xπ,\\r\\nas in (2.22).\\r\\nConversely, for a given investment strategy ϑ generating a positive wealth process, i.e., the\\r\\nnum´eraire X(·; 1, ϑ), we define a predictable, vector-valued process π ≡ (π1, · · · , πN ) as\\r\\nπi:=\\r\\nSiϑi\\r\\nX(·; 1, ϑ)\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N. (2.25)\\r\\nIt can be easily checked that π is indeed a portfolio, i.e., R-integrable and (2.14) can be written\\r\\nas\\r\\nX(·; 1, ϑ) = 1 + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX(t; 1, ϑ)\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t),\\r\\nwith the help of (2.7). This last equation gives the dynamics in (2.23) with Xπ(·) ≡ X(·; 1, ϑ).\\r\\nThus, whether we start from an investment strategy ϑ (generating a num´eraire) or from a\\r\\nportfolio π, the counterpart can always be obtained via (2.25) or (2.24), respectively, and we\\r\\nwill denote the corresponding num´eraire X(·; , 1, ϑ) in (2.14) by Xπ as in (2.22).\\r\\nIn the relationship (2.25), the product Si(t)ϑi(t) represents the amount of wealth invested in\\r\\ni-th stock at time t, thus πi(t) can be interpreted as the proportion of current wealth invested\\r\\nin i-th stock at time t. The remaining proportion of wealth\\r\\nπ0 := 1 −\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi (2.26)\\r\\nis then considered to be placed in the money market.\\r\\nWe present now a few more concepts regarding portfolios. For any two portfolios π, ρ in I(R),\\r\\nwe consider the covariation process between the cumulative returns Rπ, Rρ in (2.21), namely\\r\\nCπρ := [Rπ, Rρ] = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\ncπρ(t)dO(t), with cπρ := π\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρ =\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nπici,jρj . (2.27)\\r\\nHere, we recall the definitions of the matrix-valued processes c and C in (2.10), (2.11) and note\\r\\nthe notational consistency with (2.27). In particular, when the portfolio is given as the unit\\r\\nvector e\\r\\ni of RN for some i = 1, · · · , N, we use the subscript ‘i’ instead of ‘ei\\r\\n’ to write Ciρ ≡ Ce\\r\\niρ\\r\\nand ciρ ≡ ce\\r\\niρ\\r\\nin order to ease notation. This convention is consistent with the actual equalities\\r\\nCi,j = Ce\\r\\niej and ci,j = ceiej for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.\\r\\n7\\nBy recalling the wealth process Xπ generated by the portfolio π as in (2.22), (2.23), we can\\r\\nexpress the logarithm of Xπ as\\r\\nlog Xπ = Rπ −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nCππ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dA(t) −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nCππ +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dM(t). (2.28)\\r\\nWe call the finite-variation part of log Xπ the cumulative growth of the portfolio π, and denote\\r\\nit by\\r\\nΓπ := Aπ −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nCππ, where Aπ := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dA(t). (2.29)\\r\\nIn a similar manner, the local martingale part of the decomposition in (2.28) is denoted by\\r\\nMπ := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dM(t). (2.30)\\r\\nIn particular, the cumulative return Rπ in (2.22) is the stochastic logarithm L(Xπ) of Xπ, and\\r\\nhas ‘drift’ component Aπ as in (2.29), from (2.21) and (2.8); whereas the natural logarithm\\r\\nlog Xπ in (2.28) of Xπ has ‘drift’ term Γπ.\\r\\nWe further define the predictable processes\\r\\nαπ := π\\r\\n′α, γπ := π′α −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\ncπ = απ −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\ncππ, (2.31)\\r\\nand call απ the rate of return, and γπ the growth rate, of the portfolio π. The ‘drift parts’ Aπ\\r\\nand Γπ, of L(Xπ) and log Xπ, respectively, are then represented as the integrals of these rates\\r\\nwith respect to the ‘operational clock’ in (2.9):\\r\\nAπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nαπ(t)dO(t), Γπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nγπ(t)dO(t). (2.32)\\r\\n2.4 Portfolios among the top n stocks\\r\\nIn this subsection we provide definitions, similar to those introduced in the previous subsections,\\r\\nfor portfolios that invest only among the top n stocks.\\r\\nFor ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) and π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n), representing a strategy that invests only among\\r\\nthe top n stocks and a portfolio among the top n stocks, respectively, the equations (2.21)-(2.26)\\r\\ncan be used in the same manner. In particular, the bidirectional connections (2.24) and (2.25)\\r\\nbetween ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) and π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) still hold, because of the similarity in the\\r\\nconditions (2.15) and (2.16).\\r\\nWe define next a new N-dimensional vector Re ≡ (Re1, · · · , ReN ) by\\r\\nRei(t) := Z t\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{ui(s)≤n}dRi(s), for i = 1, · · · , N, t ≥ 0. (2.33)\\r\\nEach component Rei(t) represents the cumulative return of the i-th stock, accumulated over\\r\\n[0, t] but only at times when the stock ranks among the top n by capitalization. Then, for\\r\\nπ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n), (2.21) can be also cast as\\r\\nRπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRi(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)1{ui (t)≤n}dRi(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRei(t), (2.34)\\r\\n8\\nwhere the second equality follows from (2.18). We then have the semimartingale decomposition\\r\\nRei = Aei + Mfi, i = 1, · · · , N, (2.35)\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nAei(t) := Z t\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{ui(s)≤n}dAi(s), Mfi(t) := Z t\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{ui(s)≤n}dMi(s), i = 1, · · · , N, (2.36)\\r\\nfrom (2.8). In the decomposition Rπ = Aπ + Mπ, with Aπ as in (2.29) and Mπ as in (2.30), we\\r\\nnote that Aπ and Mπ can be expressed in terms of the components of Ae and Mf, respectively, as\\r\\nAπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dAi(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dAei(t), Mπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dMi(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dMfi(t)\\r\\n(2.37)\\r\\nby analogy with (2.34). Also in a manner similar to (2.12), we define\\r\\nCei,j := [Mfi, Mfj ] = [Rei, Rej ], for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. (2.38)\\r\\nNote the relationship\\r\\ndCei,j (t) = d[Rei, Rej ](t) = 1{ui(t)≤n}1{uj (t)≤n}d[Ri, Rj ](t) = 1{ui(t)≤n}1{uj (t)≤n}dCi,j (t) (2.39)\\r\\nbetween Ce and C. We further define a vector-valued process αe ≡ (αe1, · · · , αeN ) and a matrix\\x02valued process ec ≡ (eci,j )1≤i,j≤N as\\r\\nαei(t) := 1{ui(t)≤n}αi(t), i = 1, · · · , N, (2.40)\\r\\neci,j (t) := 1{ui(t)≤n}1{uj (t)≤n}ci,j (t), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N; (2.41)\\r\\nthen it is straightforward to obtain the relationships\\r\\nAe =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nαe(t)dO(t), and Ce ≡ [M, f Mf] = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nec(t)dO(t) (2.42)\\r\\nin accordance with (2.11), where the vector-valued and matrix-valued processes Ae ≡ (Ae1, · · · , AeN )\\r\\nand Ce ≡ (Cei,j )1≤i,j≤N , respectively, are as in (2.36), (2.38).\\r\\nThe definition of Cπρ in (2.27) can be also invoked when π, ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n), but we have\\r\\nalso with the help of (2.34) and (2.38) the alternative representation\\r\\nCπρ = [Rπ, Rρ] = \\x14 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRei(t),\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nρj (t)dRej (t)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nπi(t)ρj (t)dCei,j (t).\\r\\n(2.43)\\r\\nIn particular, consider the portfolio π among the top n stocks, defined as\\r\\nπ(·) := 1{ui(·)≤n}e\\r\\ni\\r\\n(2.44)\\r\\nfor a fixed i = 1, · · · , N. This portfolio π invests all wealth in the i-th stock, when this stock\\r\\nranks among the top n; otherwise, it puts all wealth in the money market. From (2.34), the\\r\\nidentity\\r\\nRπ = Rei (2.45)\\r\\n9\\nholds, and we shall use the subscript ‘ei’ instead of ‘π’ to write Xπ ≡ Xei\\r\\nand\\r\\nC eiρ ≡ Cπρ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nρj (t)dCei,j (t), as well as ceiρ ≡ cπρ =\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nρj (t)eci,j (t), (2.46)\\r\\nin order to ease notation for the specific π in (2.44). This convention is consistent with the\\r\\nequalities C ei,ej = [Rei, Rej ] = Cei,j for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.\\r\\nIt is useful to write succinctly the above relationships in this subsection, between symbols\\r\\nwith tilde and corresponding symbols without tilde, in matrix notation. We do this by intro\\x02ducing the predictable matrix-valued process D ≡ (Di,j )1≤i,j≤N with entries\\r\\nDi,j (t) := (\\r\\n1{ui(t)≤n}i = j,\\r\\n0 i 6= j,\\r\\n(2.47)\\r\\nfor each t ≥ 0. Here, we note that D(t) is a diagonal, idempotent matrix, whose (i, i)-th entry\\r\\nis 1 if the i-th stock belongs to the top n stocks at time t ≥ 0, otherwise it is zero. Because at\\r\\nleast N − n diagonal entries of D(t) are zero, D(·) is always singular. Then, any N-dimensional\\r\\npredictable process ν in T (n) as in Definition 2.4, satisfies Dν = ν; in particular,\\r\\nDϑ = ϑ, Dπ = π, (2.48)\\r\\nhold for all ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) and π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) from the conditions (2.17) and (2.18). Also,\\r\\nthe identities (2.33), (2.36), (2.39), (2.40), and (2.41) can be reformulated as\\r\\ndRe(t) = D(t)dR(t), dAe(t) = D(t)dA(t), dMf(t) = D(t)dM(t), (2.49)\\r\\ndCe(t) = D(t)dC(t)D(t),\\r\\nas well as\\r\\nαe = Dα, ec = DcD. (2.50)\\r\\nMoreover, we have another expression of the type (2.31) for π ∈ I(R)∩T (n): using the property\\r\\n(2.48), we write\\r\\nαπ = π\\r\\n′α = π′Dα = π′α, γ e π = π′α −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\ncπ = π\\r\\n′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′DcDπ = π′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nπ\\r\\n′\\r\\necπ. (2.51)\\r\\nWe present now the following results regarding the integrability condition with respect to R\\r\\n(or Re), which will be used in the next section.\\r\\nLemma 2.6 (Null portfolio). For an N-dimensional predictable process η ∈ T (n), suppose that\\r\\nη\\r\\n′αe = 0 and ecη = 0 hold in the (P ⊗ O)-a.e. sense.\\r\\nThen η is a portfolio, i.e., η ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n), and the identity Rη =\\r\\nR ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dRe(t) ≡ 0 holds.\\r\\nIn this case, we call η a null portfolio.\\r\\n10\\nProof. As η ∈ T (n), we have Dη = η, or η\\r\\n′ = η′D. Recalling (2.49), (2.35), and (2.42), we have\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dR(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)D(t)dR(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dRe(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dAe(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)αe(t)dO(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t). (2.52)\\r\\nThe first integral on the right-hand side of (2.52) vanishes, thanks to the assumption η\\r\\n′αe = 0.\\r\\nThe second integral R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) is a continuous local martingale, and has quadratic varia\\x02tion R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)η(t)dO(t) from (2.42). This quadratic variation also vanishes on account of the\\r\\nassumption ecη = 0, and the result follows.\\r\\nLemma 2.7 (Integrability condition with respect to R). An N-dimensional predictable vector\\r\\nprocess π ∈ T (n) belongs to I(R), if and only if\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\n|π\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)αe(t)| + π\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)π(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\ndO(t) < ∞, for any T ≥ 0.

Before we state and prove the result, we explain several necessary concepts one after\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n3.1 Auxiliary market\\r\\nConsider a portfolio ρ ∈ I(R) which generates the num´eraire Xρ as in Definition 2.5 and (2.22),\\r\\nand fix ρ throughout this subsection. We regard this portfolio ρ as a ‘baseline’, in the sense that\\r\\nwant to compare the relative performance of any other portfolio π ∈ I(R) with respect to ρ, by\\r\\nunderstanding the relative wealth process\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n:=\\r\\nXπ\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n. (3.1)\\r\\n11\\nAs the wealth Xπ is denominated relative to Xρ in (3.1), we consider an auxiliary market, in\\r\\nwhich all the components of the price vector S in Definition 2.1 are denominated in units of Xρ:\\r\\nS\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n:=\\r\\nSi\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n, i = 1, · · · , N. (3.2)\\r\\nHere, we also consider the money market S0 ≡ 1, with S\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n:= 1/Xρ, as we assume that the\\r\\nmoney market pays and charges zero interest in the introductory part of Section 2. Since S\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\nis\\r\\nno longer trivial, we will consider the (N + 1)-dimensional vector S\\r\\nρ ≡ (S\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n, Sρ\\r\\n1\\r\\n, · · · S\\r\\nρ\\r\\nN\\r\\n) as the\\r\\nprice process vector in this auxiliary market.\\r\\nRecalling the notation (2.21) and (2.27), we define two (N + 1)-dimensional vectors of semi\\x02martingales Rρ ≡ (R\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n, · · · , Rρ\\r\\nN\\r\\n), and Reρ ≡ (Reρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n, · · · , Reρ\\r\\nN\\r\\n) with components\\r\\nR\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n:= Cρρ − Rρ, and R\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n:= R\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0 + (Ri − Ciρ), for i = 1, · · · , N. (3.3)\\r\\nReρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n:= R\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0 = Cρρ − Rρ, and Reρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n:= Reρ\\r\\n0 + (Rei − Ceiρ), for i = 1, · · · , N. (3.4)\\r\\nThe following result, which builds on Proposition 1.29 of Karatzas and Kardaras (2020), shows\\r\\nthat the vectors Rρ, Reρ play the role of cumulative returns in the auxiliary market. We also\\r\\nrecall the ‘money market proportion’ π0 of a portfolio π in (2.26).\\r\\nProposition 3.1. For any two portfolios ρ, π ∈ I(R), the relative wealth process X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ of (3.1)\\r\\nadmits the representation\\r\\nXρ\\r\\nπ = E(R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n), where R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n:= Rπ−ρ − Cπ−ρ,ρ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=0\\r\\nπi(t)dRρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t). (3.5)\\r\\nIn particular, for any two portfolios ρ, π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) among the top n stocks, the process R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\nin (3.5) admits the additional representation\\r\\nR\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=0\\r\\nπi(t)dReρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t). (3.6)\\r\\nProof. The first part is exactly Proposition 1.29 of Karatzas and Kardaras (2020). Thus, it is\\r\\nenough to show R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=0 πi(t)dRρi\\r\\n(t) = R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=0 πi(t)dReρi\\r\\n(t) when ρ, π belong to I(R) ∩ T (n).\\r\\nSince Reρ\\r\\n0 = R\\r\\nρ\\r\\n0\\r\\nin (3.3) and (3.4), this reduces to showing\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)d\\r\\n\\r\\nRi − Ciρ\\x01\\r\\n(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)d\\r\\n\\r\\nRei − C eiρ\\x01\\r\\n(t).\\r\\nThanks to the condition (2.18) and the definition (2.33), this can be easily checked:\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)d\\r\\n\\r\\nRi − Ciρ\\x01\\r\\n(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)1{ui(t)≤n}d\\r\\n\\r\\nRi − Ciρ\\x01\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)d\\r\\n\\r\\nRei − C eiρ\\x01(t)\\r\\nwhere, in the last equality, we used the string of identities\\r\\n1{ui(t)≤n}dCiρ(t) = 1{ui(t)≤n}d[Ri, Rρ](t) = d[Rei, Rρ](t) = dC eiρ. (3.7)\\r\\n12\\nIn the special case π ≡ e\\r\\ni\\r\\n, that is, when the portfolio π invests all wealth in the i-th stock at\\r\\nall times, the relative wealth process X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ and its stochastic logarithm R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ in (3.1), (3.5) become\\r\\nXρ\\r\\nπ =\\r\\nSi\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= S\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n, Rρ\\r\\nπ = R\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n,\\r\\nand Proposition 3.1 yields\\r\\nS\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni = E(R\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n) (3.8)\\r\\nfor any given i = 1, · · · , N. Therefore, the component R\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\nof (3.3) is the stochastic logarithm of\\r\\nthe i-th component of the price vector S\\r\\nρ\\r\\nin the auxiliary market, and the vector Rρ plays the\\r\\nrole of cumulative returns in the auxiliary market.\\r\\nBy analogy with (2.23), we also have\\r\\ndXρ\\r\\nπ(t)\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ(t)\\r\\n= dRρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=0\\r\\nπi(t)dRρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=0\\r\\nπi(t)\\r\\ndSρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nS\\r\\nρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n, Xρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(0) = 1, (3.9)\\r\\nfor ρ, π in I(R), from (3.5), (3.8). It is very important that the summation in (3.9) should\\r\\ninclude the index i = 0, as indeed it does, in contrast to the summation in (2.23).\\r\\n3.2 Supermartingale Num´eraire and local martingale Num´eraire\\r\\nWe introduce now the notions of supermartingale num´eraire and local martingale num´eraire.\\r\\nDefinition 3.2 (Supermartingale num´eraire and local martingale num´eraire). A given portfolio\\r\\nρ ∈ I(R) is called supermatingale num´eraire portfolio (local martingale num´eraire portfolio)\\r\\nin the whole market, if the relative wealth process X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ = Xπ/Xρ of (3.1) is a supermartingale\\r\\n(local martingale) for every portfolio π ∈ I(R) in the market. In this case, the wealth process\\r\\nXρ is called a supermartingale num´eraire (local martingale num´eraire, respectively) in the whole\\r\\nmarket.\\r\\nSimilarly, a given portfolio ρ ∈ I(R)∩ T (n) among the top n stocks is called supermatingale\\r\\nnum´eraire portfolio (local martingale num´eraire portfolio) among the top n stocks, if the relative\\r\\nwealth process X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ is a supermartingale (local martingale) for every portfolio π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n)\\r\\namong the top n stocks. In this case, the wealth process Xρ is called supermartingale num´eraire\\r\\n(local martingale num´eraire, respectively) among the top n stocks.\\r\\nBy Fatou’s lemma, every nonnegative local martingale is a supermartingale; thus, every local\\r\\nmartingale num´eraire is in particular a supermatingale num´eraire. We also have the following\\r\\nuniqueness result for supermartingale (local martingale) num´eraires (respectively, among the\\r\\ntop n stocks).\\r\\nLemma 3.3. There is a unique supermartingale (local martingale) num´eraire portfolio in the\\r\\nentire market (respectively, among the top n stocks).\\r\\nProof. Suppose that there are two local martingale (or two supermartingale) num´eraire portfolios\\r\\nρ and ν with the same initial wealth Xρ(0) = Xν(0). Then, the relative wealth process Xρ/Xν\\r\\nand its reciprocal Xν /Xρ are positive supermartingales. From the Doob-Meyer decomposition\\r\\nof semimartingales, it is easy to show that a continuous, positive supermartingale Y is almost\\r\\neverywhere constant, if its reciprocal is also a supermartingale. Thus, Xρ/Xν ≡ 1 almost\\r\\neverywhere, and the two portfolios ρ and ν generate the same wealth process.\\r\\n13\\nIt can be shown that the supermartingale num´eraire is actually the local martingale num´eraire,\\r\\nthus the two num´eraires are equivalent, in the whole market where no constraint is imposed on\\r\\nportfolios. This is Proposition 2.4 of Karatzas and Kardaras (2020), which we repeat here for\\r\\nthe convenience of the reader.\\r\\nProposition 3.4. For a portfolio ρ ∈ I(R), the following statements are equivalent:\\r\\n(1) ρ is a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio in the whole market.\\r\\n(2) ρ is a local martingale num´eraire portfolio in the whole market.\\r\\n(3) The equality Ai = Ciρ holds for all i = 1, · · · , N.\\r\\nThe statement (3) gives a very simple structural condition, derived from the cumulative\\r\\nreturn process of the market, which characterizes this equivalence. It is no surprise that the\\r\\nresult also holds for the portfolios among the top n stocks; but in this case, the cumulative\\r\\nreturn process vector R in (2.6) should be replaced by Re of (2.33) instead.\\r\\nProposition 3.5. For a portfolio ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n), the following statements are equivalent:\\r\\n(1) f ρ is a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\n(2) f ρ is a local martingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\n(3) f The equality Aei = Ceiρ holds for all i = 1, · · · , N.\\r\\nProof. The proof follows the same general outline as that for Proposition 2.4 in Karatzas and Kardaras\\r\\n(2020). We first assume statement (3), which is equivalent to the requirement that Rei−Ceiρ = Mfi\\r\\nis a local martingale for all i = 1, · · · , N from (2.35). Recalling the notation of (3.4), (2.27)\\r\\nwith the identities (2.18), (2.34) and (3.7), we obtain that the process\\r\\nReρ\\r\\n0 = Cρρ − Rρ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dCiρ(t) −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dRei(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)1{ui(t)≤n}dCiρ(t) −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dRei(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dCeiρ(t) −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dRei(t) = −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nρi(t)dMfi(t) (3.10)\\r\\nis then also a local martingale. This in turn implies that all the components Reρ\\r\\ni = Reρ\\r\\n0+(Rei−Ceiρ)\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N in (3.4) are local martingales as well. Moreover, from Proposition 3.1, the\\r\\nprocesses R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ and X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ are also local martingales for every portfolio π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) among the\\r\\ntop n stocks, so the implication (3) ⇒ (2) has been proved.\\r\\nSince statement (2) trivially implies statement (1), it remains to establish the implication\\r\\n(1) ⇒ (3). Assuming statement (1), we first fix any i in {1, · · · , N}, consider a specific portfolio\\r\\nπ among the top n stocks defined as in (2.44), and recall the notation Xπ ≡ Xeias well as\\r\\nRπ ≡ Rei. Then, the processes\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρ+ei\\r\\n=\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ+ei\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n, Xρ\\r\\nρ−ei\\r\\n=\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ−ei\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n,\\r\\n14\\nare supermartingales. In view of Proposition 3.1 along with (2.45), all processes\\r\\nL(X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρ+ei\\r\\n) = R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρ+ei\\r\\n= Rei − Ceiρ, L(X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρ−ei\\r\\n) = R\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρ−ei\\r\\n= −(Rei − Ceiρ),\\r\\nare local supermartingales, implying that Rei − Ceiρ is a local martingale. Since i ∈ {1, · · · , N}\\r\\ncan be chosen arbitrarily, we arrive at statement (3).\\r\\nRemark 3.6 (Representation of wealth relative to the supermartingale num´eraire). When ρ ∈\\r\\nI(R) ∩ T (n) is a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, statement (3)\\r\\nof Proposition 3.5 implies that Rei − Ceiρ = Mfiis a local martingale for all i = 1, · · · , N. Then,\\r\\nProposition 3.1 with the notation (3.4) yields the following representation of the relative wealth\\r\\nprocess X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ for any portfolio π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) among the top n stocks, namely,\\r\\nX\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ = E\\r\\n\\x12 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=0\\r\\nπi(t)dReρ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x12\\r\\nReρ\\r\\n0 +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dMfi(t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x12 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n\\r\\nπi(t) − ρi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndMfi(t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= 1 + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n\\r\\nπi(t) − ρi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndMfi(t),\\r\\nwhere the second-last equality is from (3.10). Thus, the relative wealth process X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ is a stochastic\\r\\nintegral with respect to the local martingale vector Mf, defined in (2.36).\\r\\nRemark 3.7 (Equivalent condition of statement (3)). The statement (3) of Proposition 3.5 can\\r\\nbe reformulated using the ‘rate processes’ αe, ec of (2.42), namely,\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nαei(t)dO(t) = Aei = Ceiρ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nρj (t)dCei,j (t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nρj (t)eci,j (t)dO(t),\\r\\nwith the help of (2.46). Thus, we have the following statement (3) of Proposition 3.5, namely f\\r\\n(3) f′αe = ecρ, (P ⊗ O) − a.e. (3.11)\\r\\nin matrix notation. In the same manner, the statement (3) of Proposition 3.4 also has the\\r\\nequivalent formulation:\\r\\n(3)′ α = cρ, (P ⊗ O) − a.e. (3.12)\\r\\n3.3 Structural conditions\\r\\nIn this subsection, we present another equivalent requirement for statement (3) of Proposi\\x02tion 3.5, in the form of what we call ‘structural conditions’. First, we note that ec of (2.50) is a\\r\\nsingular symmetric matrix, thus not invertible, from the fact that D is singular. Before proceed\\x02ing to the next result, we need the following definition of ‘pseudo-inverse’ for the matrix-valued\\r\\nprocess ec of (2.41):\\r\\nec\\r\\n†\\r\\n:= lim m→∞ \\x10ec +\\r\\n1\\r\\nm\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\x01−2\\r\\nec\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n, (3.13)\\r\\nwhere I is the identity operator on R\\r\\nN . This process ec† will play the role of ‘pseudo-inverse’ for\\r\\nec, because it is easily checked that\\r\\n15\\n(a) ec\\r\\n†\\r\\nis the inverse of ec when restricted on range(ec),\\r\\n(b) ec ec\\r\\n†\\r\\ncoincides with the projection operator of R\\r\\nN onto range(ec),\\r\\n(c) ec\\r\\n†\\r\\nis predictable, since matrix inversion is a continuous operation when restricted to strictly\\r\\npositive-definite matrices.\\r\\nWe are now ready to present the structural conditions.\\r\\nProposition 3.8. The existence of the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n\\r\\nstocks, is equivalent to the conjunction of the conditions:\\r\\n(i) αe ∈ range(ec), (P ⊗ O) − a.e., (3.14)\\r\\n(ii)\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec\\r\\n†\\r\\n(t)αe(t)dO(t) < ∞, for any T ≥ 0. (3.15)\\r\\nProof. First, we assume that the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio ρ among the top n stocks\\r\\nexists; then, from statement (3’) of (3.11), the identity αe = ecρ holds. The condition (i) follows\\r\\nimmediately, and we obtain ec ec\\r\\n†αe = αe from the property (b) above. This also implies that the\\r\\nset {αe ∈ range(ec)} is predictable. We set the predictable process\\r\\nν := ec\\r\\n†α, e (3.16)\\r\\nwhich is range(ec)-valued in the (P ⊗ O)-a.e. sense, and satisfies αe = ec ν. Then, every super\\x02martingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks should be of the form\\r\\nρ = ν + η = ec\\r\\n†αe + η, (3.17)\\r\\nfor a suitable predictable process η which is in ker(ec), the kernel of ec, (P ⊗ O)-a.e. We have\\r\\necη = 0 and η\\r\\n′αe = 0, thus η is a null portfolio in the sense of Lemma 2.6.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the assumption that the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the\\r\\ntop n stocks exists, implies that some N-dimensional process of the form ρ = ec\\r\\n†αe+η of the form\\r\\n(3.17) should be a portfolio, i.e., R-integrable. The integrability condition (2.53) in Lemma 2.7\\r\\nwith the observation\\r\\nρ\\r\\n′ecρ = ρ′ec (ec†αe + η) = ρ′αe = αe′\\r\\nρ = αe\\r\\n′ec†α, e\\r\\ngives the condition (ii).\\r\\nWe next assume the conjunction of conditions (i), (ii) and find the supermartingale num´eraire\\r\\nportfolio among the top n stocks. We define the two predictable processes\\r\\nν := ec\\r\\n†α, e and ρ := Dν = Dec†α, e (3.18)\\r\\nand claim that ρ is the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks. Thanks\\r\\nto the condition (i), we obtain the identity ecν = ec ec\\r\\n†αe = αe, (P ⊗ O)-a.e. Then, we observe the\\r\\nseries of identities\\r\\nν\\r\\n′\\r\\necν = ν\\r\\n′αe = αe′\\r\\nν = αe\\r\\n′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†α, e (P ⊗ O) − a.e.,\\r\\nas well as\\r\\nρ\\r\\n′\\r\\necρ = ν\\r\\n′DecDν = ν′\\r\\necν = αe\\r\\n′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†α, ρ e′αe = ν′Dαe = ν′αe = αe′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†α, e (P ⊗ O) − a.e. (3.19)\\r\\n16\\nHere, we used the identities Dαe = αe, and DecD = ec which can be obtained from (2.50). Combin\\x02ing equations of (3.19) with the condition (ii) yields the integrability condition (2.53) for ρ ≡ π\\r\\nin Lemma 2.7, i.e., ρ ∈ I(R). Also, from the construction (3.18), we have Dρ = DDν = Dν = ρ,\\r\\nthus ρ ∈ T (n). Therefore, we have shown that ρ is a portfolio among the top n stocks, i.e.,\\r\\nρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n).\\r\\nFurthermore, we deduce\\r\\necρ = ecDν = ecν = ecec\\r\\n†αe = α, e (P ⊗ O) − a.e., (3.20)\\r\\nwhere the second equation uses the identity ecD = ec, a consequence of (2.50) and of the fact that\\r\\nD is idempotent. Thus, we have obtained the condition (3.11), which is equivalent to statement\\r\\n(3) of Proposition 3.5, and ρ is indeed the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top\\r\\nn stocks.\\r\\nThe conjunction of the two conditions in Proposition 3.8 can be formulated as one equivalent\\r\\ncondition, as follows. We first recall the ‘growth rate’ γπ of the portfolio π ∈ I(R)∩T (n) among\\r\\nthe top n stocks in (2.51). We denote R\\r\\nN ∩ T (n) the collection of elements in RN such that\\r\\nat most n components are nonzero; then π(t) takes values in R\\r\\nN ∩ T (n) for each t ≥ 0, by the\\r\\nproperty (2.16). Let us define the [0,∞]-valued process\\r\\neg := sup\\r\\np∈RN\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\np\\r\\n′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\np\\r\\n′ecp\\x11\\r\\n= sup\\r\\np∈RN ∩T (n)\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\np\\r\\n′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\np\\r\\n′ecp\\x11\\r\\n. (3.21)\\r\\nThe last equality follows because of the identities\\r\\np\\r\\n′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\np\\r\\n′ecp = p′Dαe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\np\\r\\n′DecDp = pe′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\npe\\r\\n′ecp, e\\r\\nvalid for any p ∈ R\\r\\nN , where pe := Dp ∈ RN ∩ T (n), by recalling the properties αe = Dαe and\\r\\nec = DecD which can be deduced from (2.50). This process eg can be interpreted as the maximal\\r\\ngrowth rate achievable for all portfolios among the top n stocks. Note that ge is predictable,\\r\\nbecause the supremum can be restricted over a countable, dense subset of R\\r\\nN . We then easily\\r\\nrewrite the process eg in the form\\r\\nge =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†αe\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n1{αe∈range(ec)} + ∞1{α / e∈range(ec)}, (3.22)\\r\\nand the supremum of (3.21) is attained if and only if eg < ∞, at p ≡ ρ := Dec\\r\\n†αe as in (3.18) and\\r\\n(3.19). Then, the conjunction of conditions (i) + (ii) in Proposition 3.8 becomes simply\\r\\nGe(T) < ∞, for all T ≥ 0, (3.23)\\r\\nwhere Ge is an adapted nondecreasing process\\r\\nGe := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nge(t)dO(t). (3.24)\\r\\nWe call this Ge the aggregate maximal growth from portfolios among the top n stocks; and say\\r\\nthat the market consisting of the top n stocks has locally finite growth, if the process Ge satisfies\\r\\nthe condition (3.23). We formalize this argument into the next proposition.\\r\\n17\\nProposition 3.9. The requirement of (3.23) of locally finite growth among the top n stocks, is\\r\\nequivalent to the conjunction of the two conditions (i) + (ii) of Proposition 3.8, thus sufficient\\r\\nand necessary for a supermartinagle num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks to exist. In this\\r\\ncase, we have\\r\\nGe = Γρ,\\r\\nwhere ρ is a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nWe present the following results which will be used later.\\r\\nLemma 3.10. Suppose the market has locally finite growth among the top n stocks, i.e., that\\r\\n(3.23) holds, and let ρ be the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks. Re\\x02calling (2.51), (2.32), (2.27), and (2.37), we have\\r\\nGe = Γρ =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nCρρ,\\r\\nas well as the representation\\r\\n1\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= E(−Mρ). (3.25)\\r\\nProof. As with (3.18) in the proof of Proposition 3.8, the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio ρ\\r\\namong the top n stocks is of the form Dec\\r\\n†αe. With (3.19), the claim Ge = Γρ is easily obtained.\\r\\nFurthermore, again by (3.19) with (2.51), we have\\r\\nγρ = ρ\\r\\n′αe −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nρ\\r\\n′\\r\\necρ =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nρ\\r\\n′\\r\\necρ =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\ncρρ = eg (3.26)\\r\\nthus Γρ =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2Cρρ, as well as Aρ = Cρρ. We then write (3.5), (3.6) with π ≡ (0, · · · , 0) ∈\\r\\nI(R) ∩ T (n):\\r\\n1\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= Xρ\\r\\nπ = E(Reρ\\r\\n0\\r\\n) = E(Cρρ − Rρ) = E(Cρρ − Aρ − Mρ) = E(−Mρ).\\r\\nLemma 3.11. Let ρ be the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks. For\\r\\nany investment strategy ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) among the top n stocks, and for any initial capital\\r\\nx ≥ 0, let us recall the wealth process X ≡ X(·; x, ϑ) generated by ϑ and x in the manner of\\r\\n(2.14). Then there exists a process η = (η1, · · · , ηN ) ∈ I(Mf) ∩ T (n), such that\\r\\nX\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nηi(t)dMfi(t). (3.27)\\r\\nConversely, for any x ≥ 0 and η ∈ I(M) ∩ T (n), there exists a process ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) such\\r\\nthat (3.27) holds.\\r\\n18\\nProof. From (3.25) and (2.37), we have d\\r\\n\\r\\n1/Xρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n1/Xρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 PN\\r\\ni=1 \\r\\n− ρi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndMfi(t), as well\\r\\nas the dynamics\\r\\ndX(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)Si(t)dRei(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)Si(t)\\r\\n\\r\\ndAei(t) + dMfi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n,\\r\\nfrom (2.35). Combining two equations via Itˆo’s formula, we obtain\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\nX(t)/Xρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n=\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)Si(t)\\r\\nXρ(t)\\r\\n\\r\\ndAei(t) + dMfi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n+\\r\\nX(t)\\r\\nXρ(t)\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n\\r\\n− ρi(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndMfi(t)\\r\\n+\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nϑi(t)Si(t)\\r\\nXρ(t)\\r\\n\\r\\n− ρj (t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nd[Mfi, Mfj ](t).\\r\\nHere, the finite variation terms vanish because of the relationship dAei(t) = PN\\r\\nj=1 ρj (t)d[Mfi\\r\\n, Mfj ](t)\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N, which is valid on the strength of condition (3) in Proposition 3.5. Thus, by f\\r\\nsetting\\r\\nηi(t) := ϑi(t)Si(t) − X(t)ρi(t)\\r\\nXρ(t)\\r\\n, i = 1, · · · , N,\\r\\nit is straightforward to check η ∈ T (n), and the result follows. The converse can be easily shown\\r\\nby reversing the above procedure.\\r\\n3.4 Local martingale deflator and market viability\\r\\nDefinition 3.12 (Local martingale deflator). We call an adapted, right-continuous with left\\x02limited process Y , a local martingale deflator among the top n stocks, if it satisfies Y (0) = 1,\\r\\nY > 0, and the process Y X is a local martingale for every X ∈ X n of Definition 2.4. We denote\\r\\nby Y\\r\\nn the collection of all local martingale deflators among the top n stocks.\\r\\nSince X ≡ 1 ∈ X n, every deflator Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\nis in particular local martingale.\\r\\nDefinition 3.13 (cumulative withdrawal stream). We denote by K the collection of all non\\x02decreasing, adapted and right-continuous processes K with K(0) = 0. Any element K of K is\\r\\ncalled cumulative withdrawal process, and K(t) represents for the cumulative capital withdrawn\\r\\nup to time t ≥ 0; actual withdrawals in each infinitesimal interval (t, t + dt] are represented as\\r\\ndK(t). We say that K ∈ K is nonzero, if P\\r\\n\\r\\nK(∞) > 0\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n> 0.\\r\\nFor x ≥ 0, ϑ ∈ I(S) or ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n), the wealth process X(·; x, ϑ) defined in (2.14) is\\r\\nsaid to finance a given cumulative withdrawal process K ∈ K, if X ≥ K holds. In this case, we\\r\\nsay the process K is financeable from the initial capital x ≥ 0 with the investment strategy ϑ.\\r\\nWe denote by K(x), Kn(x) the subset of K consisting of cumulative capital withdrawal\\r\\nprocesses financeable from initial capital x; namely:\\r\\nK(x) := {K ∈ K | ∃ ϑ ∈ I(S) such that X(·; x, ϑ) ≥ K}, (3.28)\\r\\nK\\r\\nn\\r\\n(x) := {K ∈ K | ∃ ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) such that X(·; x, ϑ) ≥ K}, (3.29)\\r\\n19\\nWe introduce also the collection of cumulative withdrawal processes in K which can be\\r\\nfinanced starting from any positive initial capital:\\r\\nK(0+) := \\\\\\r\\nx>0\\r\\nK(x) ⊂ K, K\\r\\nn\\r\\n(0+) := \\\\\\r\\nx>0\\r\\nK\\r\\nn\\r\\n(x) ⊂ K. (3.30)\\r\\nDefinition 3.14 (Superhedging capital). For any cumulative withdrawal process K ∈ K, we\\r\\ncall the quantities\\r\\nx(K) := inf{x ≥ 0 | K ∈ K(x)} = inf{x ≥ 0 | ∃ ϑ ∈ I(S) such that X(·; x, ϑ) ≥ K}, (3.31)\\r\\nx\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) := inf{x ≥ 0 | K ∈ K\\r\\nn\\r\\n(x)} = inf{x ≥ 0 | ∃ ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) such that X(·; x, ϑ) ≥ K}\\r\\n(3.32)\\r\\nthe superhedging capital associated with the withdrawal stream K in the entire market, and in\\r\\nthe market consisting of the top n stocks, respectively. We follow here the standard convention\\r\\nthat the infimum of an empty set is equal to infinity.\\r\\nLemma 3.15. Suppose that Y\\r\\nn\\r\\nis nonempty. For a fixed cumulative withdrawal process K ∈\\r\\nK, we assume that it is financeable from the initial capital x ≥ 0 with investment strategy\\r\\nϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n), i.e.,\\r\\nX ≡ X(·; x, ϑ) = x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t) ≥ K.\\r\\nThen, the process\\r\\nY (X − K) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t)\\r\\nis a nonnegative local martingale, thus also a supermartingale, for every local martingale deflator\\r\\nY ∈ Y\\r\\nn among the top n stocks. In particular, Y (X − K) is nonnegative supermartingale, for\\r\\nevery Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n. Furthermore, for the quantity x\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) of (3.32) we have the inequality\\r\\nx\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) ≥ sup\\r\\nY ∈Yn\\r\\nE\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x14 Z ∞\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n. (3.33)\\r\\nProof. For every Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n, integration by parts gives\\r\\nY (X − K) = Y X −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t) −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nK(t−)dY (t),\\r\\nthus\\r\\nY (X − K) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t) = Y X −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nK(t−)dY (t). (3.34)\\r\\nBoth terms on the right-hand side of (3.34) are local martingales, and the terms on the left hand\\r\\nside of (3.34) are nonnegative; thus the first claim follows. Also, the process R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t) is\\r\\nnondecreasing, therefore Y (X − K) is nonnegative supermartingale. We denote the left hand\\r\\nside of (3.34) by Q := Y (X − K) + R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t), then we obtain\\r\\nQ(0) = x ≥ E\\r\\nP\\r\\nh\\r\\nQ(∞)\\r\\ni\\r\\n≥ E\\r\\nP\\r\\nh Z ∞\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t)\\r\\ni\\r\\n.\\r\\nBy taking the supremum over Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn and then the infimum over the initial capital x ≥ 0, the\\r\\nlast claim follows.\\r\\n20\\nDefinition 3.16 (Viability). We say that the entire market is viable if, whenever x(K) = 0\\r\\nholds for some cumulative withdrawal process K ∈ K, we have K ≡ 0.\\r\\nIn the same manner, we say the market consisting of the top n stocks is viable, if whenever\\r\\nx\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) = 0 holds for some cumulative withdrawal process K ∈ K, we have K ≡ 0.\\r\\nThe viability of the market consisting of the top n stocks, is actually equivalent to the\\r\\nidentity\\r\\nK\\r\\nn\\r\\n(0+) = {0}; (3.35)\\r\\nwhereas the failure of such viability implies the strict inclusion Kn(0+) ⊃ {0}. When the\\r\\nviability of the market consisting of the top n stocks fails, there exists a nonzero cumulative\\r\\nwithdrawal process K ∈ K which is financeable from any initial capital x > 0, no matter how\\r\\nminuscule; or equivalently, there exists an investment strategy ϑm ∈ I(R)∩T (n) for each m ∈ N,\\r\\nsuch that\\r\\nX(·;\\r\\n1\\r\\nm\\r\\n, ϑm) ≥ K. (3.36)\\r\\nWe further present the following lemma; it can be proven in the same manner as Exercise 2.22\\r\\nof Karatzas and Kardaras (2020).\\r\\nLemma 3.17. The market consisting of the top n stocks fails to be viable if, and only if,\\r\\nthere exist a real number T ≥ 0 and a nonnegative F(T)-measurable random variable h with\\r\\nP[h > 0] > 0 such that for every m ∈ N, there exists an Xm ∈ X n with Xm(T) ≥ mh.\\r\\nThe following result presents another equivalent characterization of viability for the market\\r\\nconsisting of the top n stocks.\\r\\nProposition 3.18 (Boundedness in probability). The market consisting of the top n stocks is\\r\\nviable if, and only if,\\r\\nlim m→∞sup\\r\\nX∈X n\\r\\nP[X(T) > m] = 0, ∀ T ≥ 0. (3.37)\\r\\nProof. We first assume that the market consisting of the top n stocks is not viable. Then,\\r\\nfrom Lemma 3.17, there exist a real number T ≥ 0, a nonnegative F(T)-measurable random\\r\\nvariable h with P[h > 0] > 0, and a sequence (Xm)m∈N of wealth processes Xm ∈ X nsatisfying\\r\\nXm(T) ≥ mh. Pick ǫ > 0 sufficiently small, so that P[h > ǫ] > ǫ holds. We then have\\r\\nlim inf\\r\\nm→∞\\r\\nP[X\\r\\nm(T) > ǫm] ≥ lim inf\\r\\nm→∞\\r\\nP[X\\r\\nm(T) > mh, h > ǫ] ≥ ǫ,\\r\\nthus the condition (3.37) is violated.\\r\\nConversely, we assume that for some T ≥ 0, there exist ǫ > 0 and a sequence (Xm)m∈N ⊂ X n\\r\\nsuch that P[Xm(T) > m2\\r\\nm] > ǫ hold for all m ∈ N. Consider the set\\r\\nH := \\\\∞\\r\\nm=1\\r\\n[∞\\r\\nk=m\\r\\n\\x08\\r\\nX\\r\\nk\\r\\n(T) > k2\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n∈ F(T),\\r\\nand note that P(H) ≥ ǫ. For every m ∈ N, the inclusion\\r\\nH ⊆\\r\\n[∞\\r\\nk=m+1\\r\\n{Xk(T) > k2\\r\\nk\\r\\n}\\r\\n21\\nholds, so there exists a sufficiently large number Km > m such that the set\\r\\nHm := H ∩\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\nK\\r\\n[m\\r\\nk=m+1\\r\\n{X\\r\\nk\\r\\n(T) > k2\\r\\nk\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n∈ F(T)\\r\\nsatisfies P[H \\\\ Hm] ≤\\r\\nP[H]\\r\\n2m+1 . Then, the countable intersection\\r\\nE := \\\\∞\\r\\nm=1\\r\\nHm ∈ F(T)\\r\\nis a subset of H, and we have\\r\\nP[H \\\\ E] = P\\r\\nh [∞\\r\\nm=1\\r\\n(H \\\\ Hm)\\r\\ni\\r\\n≤\\r\\nX∞\\r\\nm=1\\r\\nP[H]\\r\\n2m+1 =\\r\\nP[H]\\r\\n2\\r\\n,\\r\\nthus, P[E] ≥\\r\\nP[H]\\r\\n2\\r\\nand P[E] ≥\\r\\nǫ\\r\\n2 > 0. Let us define a sequence of num´eraires (Ξm)m∈N\\r\\nΞ\\r\\nm := X\\r\\nKm\\r\\nk=m+1\\r\\n2\\r\\n−(k−m)Xk\\r\\n, for each m ∈ N,\\r\\nand it is straightforward that Ξm ∈ X n, as all Xk ∈ X nfor k ∈ N. Furthermore, for every m ∈ N,\\r\\nwe have E ⊆ Hm ⊆ {Ξ\\r\\nm(T) > m}, from which Ξm(T) ≥ m1E follows. Set h := 1E ∈ F(T),\\r\\nthen\\r\\nP[h > 0] = P[E] ≥\\r\\nǫ\\r\\n2\\r\\n> 0.\\r\\nLemma 3.17 yields that the market consisting of the top n stocks is not viable.\\r\\nWe are now ready to state and prove the main result of this section.\\r\\nTheorem 3.19. The following statements are equivalent:\\r\\n(1) The market consisting of the top n stocks is viable.\\r\\n(2) There exists a local martingale deflator among the top n stocks, i.e., Y\\r\\nn 6= ∅.\\r\\n(3) The supermartingale num´eraire among the top n stocks exists.\\r\\n(4) The market consisting of the top n stocks has locally finite growth; namely, the condition\\r\\n(3.23) of the aggregate maximal growth process Ge among the top n stocks of (3.24) holds.\\r\\nProof. The implication (4) ⇒ (3) follows from Proposition 3.9. The implication (3) ⇒ (2)\\r\\nalso follows easily, because the supermartingale num´eraire among the top n stocks is a local\\r\\nmartingale num´eraire among the top n stocks from Proposition 3.5, and the reciprocal of the\\r\\nlocal martingale num´eraire among the top n stocks is a local martingale deflator among the top\\r\\nn stocks.\\r\\nIn order to prove (2) ⇒ (1), let Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn be a local martingale deflator and pick a cumulative\\r\\nwithdrawal process K ∈ K such that x\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) = 0. From (3.33) of Lemma 3.15, we have\\r\\nE\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x14 Z ∞\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t−)dK(t)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n= 0.\\r\\n22\\nSince Y is strictly positive and K is nondecreasing with K(0) = 0, it follows that K(∞) = 0\\r\\nholds P-a.e., which is equivalent to K ≡ 0. The market consisting of the top n stocks is then\\r\\nviable.\\r\\nThe remaining part is to show the implication (1) ⇒ (4), which is quite technical. Suppose\\r\\nthat the market fails to have locally finite growth among the top n stocks, i.e., one of the\\r\\nstructural conditions (3.14), (3.15) is violated. Thus, we need to consider two cases:\\r\\n(A) the set {αe 6∈ range(ec)} fails to be (P ⊗ O)-null,\\r\\n(B) the set {αe 6∈ range(ec)} is (P ⊗ O)-null, but P[Ge(T) = ∞] > 0 holds for some T > 0.\\r\\nWe shall show that the market is not viable in each of the cases (A) and (B) below.\\r\\n∗ Case (A). Recalling the notation (3.13) with its properties (a)-(c), we first note that the\\r\\npredictable process\\r\\nϕ :=\\r\\n1\\r\\n||αe − ecec\\r\\n†αe||2\\r\\n\\r\\nαe − ecec\\r\\n†αe\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n1{αe6∈range(ec)}, (3.38)\\r\\nis well-defined, because αe 6∈ range(ec) holds if and only if ecec\\r\\n†αe 6= αe. Note that Dϕ = ϕ, thus\\r\\nϕ ∈ T (n), thanks to the properties Dαe = αe, Dec = ec from (2.50). Since the process αe − ecec\\r\\n†αe is\\r\\northogonal to range(ec), we have ecϕ = 0. Furthermore, we have ϕ\\r\\n′αe = 1{αe6∈range(ec)}\\r\\n, because\\r\\n(αe − ecec\\r\\n†αe)′αe = ||αe − ecec†αe||2 + (αe − ecec†αe)′\\r\\n(ecec\\r\\n†αe) = ||αe − ecec†αe||2\\r\\n.\\r\\nThus, from Lemma 2.7, ϕ is a portfolio among the top n stocks, i.e., ϕ ∈ I(R)∩T (n). Also, the\\r\\nlocal martingale vanishes: R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) ≡ 0, because its quadratic variation process vanishes\\r\\nh Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t)\\r\\ni\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)ϕ(t)dO(t) ≡ 0. (3.39)\\r\\nThus,\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dRe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dAe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)αe(t)dO(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{αe6∈range(ec)}(t)dO(t) =: K.\\r\\nWe define the vector process ϑ ≡ (ϑ1, · · · , ϑN ) with components given by ϑi = ϕi/Sifor i =\\r\\n1, · · · , N. It is then easy to check that mϑ is an investment strategy among the top n stocks,\\r\\ni.e., mϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n), for any m ∈ N, and\\r\\nX(·; 0, mϑ) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nmϑ′(t)dS(t) = m\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dR(t) = m\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dRe(t) = mK.\\r\\nIn other words, for any m ∈ N, the wealth process generated by the investment strategy mϑ\\r\\namong the top n stocks has vanishing local martingale part, and is equal to the non-trivial,\\r\\nnondecreasing part mK of finite variation. This process mK can be arbitrarily scaled by the\\r\\nmultiplicative constant m ∈ N, and thus x\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) = 0, by recalling (3.32). We conclude that the\\r\\nmarket consisting of the top n stocks is not viable.\\r\\n∗ Case (B). We assume that the set {αe 6∈ range(ec)} is (P ⊗ O)-null, but P[Ge(T) = ∞] > 0\\r\\nholds for some T > 0. In this case, the aggregate maximal growth process Ge of (3.24) becomes\\r\\nGe =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec\\r\\n†\\r\\n(t)αe(t)dO(t). (3.40)\\r\\n23\\nWe consider first the portfolio ρ := Dec\\r\\n†αe ∈ T (n) as in (3.18), and also set ρm := ρ1{||ρ||≤m} ∈\\r\\nI(R) ∩ T (n). The log-wealth process of (2.28) can be represented, with the help of (2.37) and\\r\\n(3.19), as\\r\\nlog Xρm =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{||ρ(t)||≤m}ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)ρ(t)dO(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{||ρ(t)||≤m}ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t). (3.41)\\r\\nNote that the first integral on the right-hand side of (3.41), namely\\r\\n2G\\r\\nm := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{||ρ(t)||≤m}ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)ρ(t)dO(t),\\r\\nis the quadratic variation of the local martingale R ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{||ρ(t)||≤m}ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t), which is the sec\\x02ond integral on the right-hand side of (3.41). The Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz representation (cf.\\r\\nTheorem 3.4.6 and Problem 3.4.7 of Karatzas and Shreve (1991)), with the scaling property\\r\\nof Brownian motion, implies that there exists a Brownian motion Wm, on a possibly enlarged\\r\\nfiltered probability space, such that\\r\\nlog Xρm = G\\r\\nm +\\r\\n√\\r\\n2Wm(G\\r\\nm), (3.42)\\r\\nfor every m ∈ N. The sequence {Gm(T)}m∈N is nondecreasing and converges to\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec(t)ρ(t)dO(t) = 1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)ec\\r\\n†\\r\\n(t)αe(t)dO(t) = Ge(T),\\r\\nas in (3.40), again with the help of (3.19). The strong law of large numbers for Brownian motion\\r\\ngives\\r\\nlim m→∞P\\r\\n\\x14Wm\\r\\n\\r\\nGm(T)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nGm(T)\\r\\n≤ −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n√\\r\\n2\\r\\n, Ge(T) = ∞\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n= 0.\\r\\nFrom the representation (3.42), we obtain\\r\\nlim m→∞P\\r\\n\\x14\\r\\nlog Xρm (T)\\r\\nGm(T)\\r\\n≤\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n, Ge(T) = ∞\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n= 0.\\r\\nTherefore, in case (B), the collection of random variables {Xρm (T) | m ∈ N} ⊆ {X(T) | X ∈ X n}\\r\\nfails to be bounded in probability, and Proposition 3.18 concludes that the market consisting of\\r\\nthe top n stocks is not viable.\\r\\n3.5 Growth optimality and relative log-optimality\\r\\nThe results in the previous subsection characterize the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks, via the ‘structural condition’, in terms of αe and ec. More specifically, in\\r\\nthe argument leading to Proposition 3.8 and in the proof of Lemma 3.10, the maximal growth\\r\\nrate among the top n stocks eg of (3.21) is attained when the portfolio is the supermartingale\\r\\nnum´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, as in (3.26). In this subsection, we reformulate\\r\\nthis property and show that the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio is ‘optimal’ in some sense\\r\\namong portfolios of top n stocks.\\r\\n24\\nDefinition 3.20 (Relative growth and growth optimality). We define the relative growth of a\\r\\ngiven portfolio π ∈ I(R) with respect to another portfolio ρ ∈ I(R) as\\r\\nΓ\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n:= Γπ − Γρ, (3.43)\\r\\nnamely, the difference between the finite variation process of the log-relative wealth process\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ = log(Xπ/Xρ) from (2.29), (3.1).\\r\\nWe call a portfolio ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) growth-optimal among the top n stocks, if for every\\r\\nportfolio π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) the process Γρ\\r\\nπ = Γπ − Γρ is non-increasing.\\r\\nProposition 3.21. A portfolio is growth-optimal among the top n stocks, if and only if it is a\\r\\nsupermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nProof. (i) Let us first assume that ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) is the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks. From Proposition 3.8 and (3.11), we know that αe ∈ range(ec) and\\r\\nαe = ecρ hold (P ⊗ O) − a.e. Recalling (2.51), (3.21) and the fact that the supremum of g is\\r\\nattained at the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, γρ = ge ≥ γπ holds\\r\\n(P ⊗ O) − a.e. for every π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n). Thus, ρ is growth-optimal.\\r\\n(ii) Next, we assume that ν ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) is a growth-optimal portfolio among the top\\r\\nn stocks. We pick a portfolio ϕ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) satisfying ecϕ = 0 and ϕ\\r\\n′αe = 1 on the set\\r\\n{αe 6∈ range(ec)} (for example, as in (3.38) in the proof of Theorem 3.19). We then have\\r\\nγν+ϕ = γν + 1 on {αe 6∈ range(ec)} from (2.51), violating the growth-optimality of ν. This\\r\\nimplies that the latter set is (P ⊗ O)-null. In particular, g <e ∞ in the (P ⊗ O) − a.e. sense, from\\r\\n(3.22).\\r\\nOn the other hand, we let ρ := Dec\\r\\n†αe ∈ T (n) and define ρm := ρ1{||ρ||≤m} ∈ I(R)∩T (n) for\\r\\nm ∈ N. The equation (3.26) yields γν ≥ γρm = eg1{||ρ||≤m}, and thus γν ≥ ge holds (P ⊗ O) − a.e.\\r\\nby taking the limit m → ∞. We conclude that ν is also a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks.\\r\\nThe supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks is ‘optimal’ also in another\\r\\nsense, as follows.\\r\\nDefinition 3.22. A portfolio ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) is called relatively log-optimal among the top n\\r\\nstocks, if for all portfolios π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) and for all stopping times τ of F, we have\\r\\nE\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x02 log X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ )\\r\\n\\x01+\\x03\\r\\n< ∞, and E\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x02\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ )\\r\\n\\x03\\r\\n≤ 0. (3.44)\\r\\nProposition 3.23. A portfolio is relatively log-optimal among the top n stocks, if and only if\\r\\nit is a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nProof. (i) We first suppose that ρ ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) is the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks. Then, we obtain\\r\\nE\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x02 log X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ )\\r\\n\\x01+\\x03\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ∞\\r\\n0\\r\\nP(X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ ) > et)dt ≤\\r\\nZ ∞\\r\\n0\\r\\nP(X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ ) > t)dt ≤ E\\r\\nP\\r\\n[X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(τ )] ≤ 1,\\r\\nwhere the last inequality is from the Optional Sampling Theorem. By applying Jensen’s in\\x02equality to this last inequality, the second condition of (3.44) also holds, and we conclude that\\r\\nρ is relatively log-optimal among the top n stocks.\\r\\n25\\n(ii) For the converse implication, we assume that ν ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) is relatively log-optimal\\r\\namong the top n stocks. As in the proof of Proposition 3.21, we pick a portfolio ϕ ∈ I(R)∩T (n)\\r\\nas in (3.38), satisfying ecϕ = 0 and ϕ\\r\\n′αe = 1 on the set {αe 6∈ range(ec)}. By recalling (2.28),\\r\\n(2.29), (2.32), (2.37), and (2.51), straightforward computations show\\r\\nlog Xν\\r\\nν+ϕ = log Xν+ϕ − log Xν =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nγν+ϕ(t) − γν(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndO(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nϕ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) (3.45)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{αe6∈range(ec)}\\r\\n(t)dO(t).\\r\\nHere, the last integral on the right-hand side of (3.45) vanishes, because of the equation (3.39)\\r\\nabove. The relative log-optimality of ν implies that the set {αe 6∈ range(ec)} is (P ⊗ O)-null. We\\r\\nthen consider a process ρ := Dec\\r\\n†αe ∈ T (n) of (3.18), as in the proof of Proposition 3.21. Note\\r\\nthat αe = ecρ holds (P⊗O)−a.e. from (3.20), or equivalently, Aei = Ceiρ hold for i = 1, · · · , N, from\\r\\nRemark 3.7. This last requirement implies that Aπ = Cπρ, thus Rπ − Cπρ is local martingale for\\r\\nevery π ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n). We further define\\r\\nν\\r\\nm := ν1{αe=ecν} + ν1{αe6=ecν}1{||ρ||>m} + ρ1{αe6=ecν}1{||ρ||≤m}\\r\\n, for m ∈ N,\\r\\nand it is easy to check that ν\\r\\nm ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n) for all m ∈ N.\\r\\nWe now claim that the ratio Xν/Xνm for every m ∈ N is a local martingale. Proposition 3.1\\r\\nimplies that it is sufficient to show Rνm\\r\\nν = Rπ − Cπνm =: Q is a local martingale, where we set\\r\\nπ := ν − ν\\r\\nm ∈ I(R) ∩ T (n). On the set ζ := {αe 6= ecν, ||ρ|| ≤ m}, we have νm = ρ, thus Q is\\r\\nlocal martingale. On the complement set ζ\\r\\nc\\r\\n, we have π = ν − ν\\r\\nm = 0, thus Q = 0. In other\\r\\nwords, we showed that\\r\\nQ =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1ζ (t)dQ(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1ζ (t)d(Rπ − Cπρ)(t)\\r\\nis local martingale, verifying our claim that Xν/Xνm is a local martingale for every m ∈ N. As\\r\\nthe ratio is positive, Xν/Xνm is also a supermartingale.\\r\\nIf we assume that P[Xν(T) 6= Xνm(T)] > 0 were true for some T > 0, we obtain\\r\\nE\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x14\\r\\nlog Xν\\r\\n(T)\\r\\nXνm(T)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n< log E\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\x14\\r\\nXν(T)\\r\\nXνm(T)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n≤ 0,\\r\\ncontradicting the relative log-optimality of ν. Thus, we conclude that Xν = Xνm, from the\\r\\ncontinuity of Xν /Xνm, and ν − ν\\r\\nm is a null portfolio in the sense of Lemma 2.6. We then have\\r\\necνm = ecν = ecρ = αe, (P ⊗ O) − a.e, on the set ζ = {αe 6= ecν, ||ρ|| ≤ m} defined above, which\\r\\nimplies that ζ is (P ⊗ O)-null. Since this property is true for every m ∈ N, the identity αe = ecν is\\r\\nvalid (P⊗O)−a.e, thus ν is the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nIn part (ii) of the proofs of both Proposition 3.21 and Proposition 3.23, we did not assume the\\r\\nexistence of supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks. Thus, the existence\\r\\nof growth-optimal or relatively log-optimal portfolio among the top n stocks is equivalent to the\\r\\nexistence of the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, and we can add\\r\\nthe following two statements to the list of equivalences in Theorem 3.19:\\r\\n(5) A growth-optimal portfolio among the top n stocks exists.\\r\\n(6) A relatively log-optimal portfolio among the top n stocks exists.\\r\\n26\\n3.6 The optional decomposition\\r\\nSuppose that we are given a nonnegative, adapted process with RCLL paths and X(0) = x ≥ 0.\\r\\nIn this subsection, we characterize the condition when X belongs to X n of Definition 2.4, i.e.,\\r\\nwhen X is the wealth process generated by an investment strategy that invests in the top n\\r\\nstocks of the market, and study how can we construct this strategy from X. The following\\r\\nTheorem 3.25 (or Corollary 3.26), which we call the Optional Decomposition Theorem, gives\\r\\nthe answer to this question.\\r\\nWe first present the following result, originally from Theorem 1 of Schweizer (1995). See\\r\\nalso Propositions 2.3 and 3.2 of Larsen and Zitkovi´c (2007). We recall for this purpose the ˇ\\r\\nsemimartingale vector Mf defined in (2.36) and write M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) the collection of scalar local\\r\\nmartingales L with RCLL paths, satisfying L(0) = 0 and the orthogonality [L, Mfi] = 0 for all\\r\\ni = 1, · · · , N.\\r\\nLemma 3.24. If the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio ρ among the top n stocks exists, then\\r\\nthe collections Y\\r\\nn of local martingale deflators among the top n stocks, defined in Definition 3.12,\\r\\nadmits the representation:\\r\\nY\\r\\nn =\\r\\nn 1\\r\\nXρ\\r\\nE(L) : L ∈ M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) with ∆L > −1\\r\\no\\r\\n. (3.46)\\r\\nIn order to simplify the proof of the Optional Decomposition Theorem, we shall work under\\r\\nthe following assumption. The general case of the Theorem can be proven as in the Subsection\\r\\n3.1.3 of Karatzas and Kardaras (2020).\\r\\nAssumption ⋆ : All local martingales on the filtered probability space (Ω, F, F(·), P) have\\r\\ncontinuous paths.\\r\\nTheorem 3.25 (Optional Decomposition). Suppose that the market consisting of the top n\\r\\nstocks is viable. For a nonnegative, adapted process X with RCLL paths satisfying X(0) = x ≥ 0,\\r\\nthe following statements are equivalent:\\r\\n(1) The process Y X is a supermartingale, for every Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n.\\r\\n(2) There exist an investment strategy ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) among the top n stocks, and a cumu\\x02lative withdrawal process K ∈ K, such that\\r\\nX = x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t) − K. (3.47)\\r\\nProof. We first show the implication (2) =⇒ (1). For any Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n, we write Y = E(L)/Xρ for\\r\\nsome L ∈ M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) with ∆L > −1 from Lemma 3.24, where we denote by ρ the supermartingale\\r\\nnum´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks. Then, we have from Lemma 3.11,\\r\\nY X + Y K =\\r\\nx +\\r\\nR ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=1 ϑi(t)dSi(t)\\r\\nXρ\\r\\nE(L) = \\x10x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nηi(t)dMfi(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\nE(L),\\r\\nfor some process η ∈ I(Mf) ∩ T (n). The last expression is a product of two nonnegative,\\r\\northogonal local martingales, thus it is a nonnegative local martingale. The claim that Y X is a\\r\\nsupermartingale follows.\\r\\n27\\nWe now show the implication (1) =⇒ (2) which is more involved, under the above As\\x02sumption ⋆. We assume that (1) holds and recall the collections Y\\r\\nn and M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) of (3.46).\\r\\nAll processes in M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) have continuous paths under the Assumption ⋆. From Lemma 3.24,\\r\\n(X/Xρ)E(L) is a supermartingale for every L ∈ M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf), and in particular, X/Xρ is a super\\x02martingale itself. The Doob-Meyer and Kunita-Watanabe decompositions give\\r\\nX\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= x + Mη + L − B, where Mη := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nηi(t)dMfi(t).\\r\\nHere, η ≡ (η1, · · · , ηN ) ∈ I(Mf), L ∈ M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf) and B is an adapted, nondecreasing and right\\x02continuous process with B(0) = 0, i.e., B is a cumulative withdrawal process in K. Recalling the\\r\\ndiagonal matrix D of (2.47) with its property DdMf(t) = dMf(t), we further define ηe := Dη ∈\\r\\nI(Mf) ∩ T (n), and we have\\r\\nMη =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nη\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n(Dη)\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t) = Mηe.\\r\\nConsequently, we obtain\\r\\nX\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= x + Mηe + L − B, with ηe ∈ I(Mf) ∩ T (n), L ∈ M⊥\\r\\nloc(Mf). (3.48)\\r\\nWe next show that L ≡ 0 in (3.48). Again from Lemma 3.24, (1/Xρ)E(mL) is a local\\r\\nmartingale, thus (X/Xρ)E(mL) is a supermartingale for every m ∈ N. Since [E(mL), Mfi] = 0\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N, we have [E(mL), Mηe] = 0 and consequently, E(mL)Mηe is a local martingale as\\r\\na product of two orthogonal local martingales. Thus, from (3.48), the process\\r\\nE(mL)(L − B) = E(mL)\\r\\nX\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n− E(mL)(x + Mηe)\\r\\nis a local supermartingale for every m ∈ N. On the other hand, the integration by parts gives\\r\\nE(mL)(L−B) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n(L−B)(t−)dE(mL)(t)+Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nE(mL)(t)dL(t)+Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nE(mL)(t)d\\r\\n\\r\\n[mL, L]−B\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n(t).\\r\\nThen, the last integrator m[L, L] − B should be a local supermartingale for every m ∈ N, which\\r\\nimplies [L, L] ≡ 0, thus L ≡ 0.\\r\\nAs a result, the equation (3.48) becomes\\r\\nX\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n= x + Mηe − B,\\r\\nand we apply the product rule to obtain the decomposition of X = Xρ(X/Xρ):\\r\\nX = x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX(t−)ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dR(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXρ(t)d(Mηe − B)(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXρ(t)dCηρe (t),\\r\\nin conjunction with (2.23) and (2.43). Moreover, the condition (e3) of Proposition 3.5 implies\\r\\nCηρe = Aηe = Rηe − Mηe, and we deduce\\r\\nX = x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nX(t−)ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t) − Xρ(t)ηe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndR(t) −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXρ(t)dB(t).\\r\\n28\\nTherefore, if we define\\r\\nϑi(t) := X(t−)ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t) − Xρ(t)ηe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nSi(t)\\r\\n, i = 1, · · · , N, K := Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXρ(t)dB(t),\\r\\nthen it is easy to check that ϑ ≡ (ϑ1, · · · , ϑN ) ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) and K ∈ K.\\r\\nCorollary 3.26. Suppose that the market consisting of the top n stocks is viable. For a non\\x02negative, adapted process X with RCLL paths satisfying X(0) = x ≥ 0, the following statements\\r\\nare then equivalent:\\r\\n(1) The process Y X is a local martingale, for every Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n.\\r\\n(2) There exists an investment strategy ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) among the top n stocks, such that\\r\\nX = x +\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t). (3.49)\\r\\nProof. We first assume (1); then Y X is a supermartingale for every Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\n. From Theo\\x02rem 3.25, we have a decomposition (3.47) for some ϑ ∈ I(S) ∩ T (n) and K ∈ K. In particular,\\r\\nif we take Y = 1/Xρ, the reciprocal of the local martingale num´eraire, we obtain\\r\\nY K =\\r\\nX(·; x, ϑ)\\r\\nXρ\\r\\n− Y X,\\r\\nwith the notation in (2.14). Since the terms on the right-hand side are local martingales, Y K\\r\\nis a local martingale, and so is\\r\\nY K −\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nK(t−)dY (t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nY (t)dK(t).\\r\\nHowever, the last integral is nondecreasing and is a supermartingale (as a non-negative local\\r\\nmartingale), and therefore identically equal to zero. Thus, K ≡ 0 as Y is positive, and the\\r\\nstatement (2) follows.\\r\\nIn order to show the reverse implication, we assume (2), then X/Xρ is a local martingale\\r\\nwhere ρ is the local martingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, as before. From\\r\\nLemma 3.11, X/Xρ can be cast as a stochastic integral with respect to the local martingale\\r\\nvector Mf. Furthermore, from Lemma 3.24, every Y ∈ Y\\r\\nn\\r\\nis of the form Y = (1/Xρ)E(L)\\r\\nfor some local martingale L satisfying [L, Mfi] = 0 for i = 1, · · · , N. Therefore, the product\\r\\nY X = (X/Xρ)E(L) of these two orthogonal local martingales is again a local martingale.\\r\\n29\\n3.7 Entire market versus top n market\\r\\nWe present first the following result, which can be easily proven from the equivalence between\\r\\nthe existence of supermartingale num´eraire portfolio and the market viability.\\r\\nTheorem 3.27. The existence of a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio in the whole market,\\r\\nimplies the existence of supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nProof. From Theorem 2.34 of Karatzas and Kardaras (2020), the existence of a supermartingale\\r\\nnum´eraire portfolio in the whole market, is equivalent to the viability of the whole market. The\\r\\nviability of the whole market implies the viability of the market consisting of the top n stocks,\\r\\nthanks to the inequality 0 ≤ x(K) ≤ x\\r\\nn\\r\\n(K) in Definition 3.14. We conclude that there exists a\\r\\nsupermartingale num´eraire portfolio among the top n stocks, from Theorem 3.19.\\r\\nTheorem 3.27 shows that the viability of the entire market, composed of N stocks, implies\\r\\nthe viability of the ‘top n market’. Thus, if the entire market is viable, there exist both a super\\x02martingale num´eraire portfolio for the whole market, and a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks, and the former dominates the latter in the sense of growth-optimality.\\r\\nIn the following proposition, we study this dominance by expressing the asymptotic behavior of\\r\\nlog-relative wealth process between these two portfolios in terms of the ‘local characteristics’ of\\r\\nthe market. We first need the following definitions which are similar to those in (3.21)-(3.24).\\r\\nWe call a [0,∞]-valued, predictable process\\r\\ng := sup\\r\\np∈RN\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\np\\r\\n′α −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\np\\r\\n′\\r\\ncp\\x11(3.50)\\r\\nmaximal growth rate achievable in the whole market. This process can be rewritten in the form\\r\\ng =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nα\\r\\n′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n1{α∈range(c)} + ∞1{α /∈range(c)}, (3.51)\\r\\nand the supremum of (3.50) is attained if and only if g < ∞, at p ≡ ρ := c\\r\\n†α, i.e., when ρ is\\r\\nthe supermartingale num´eraire portfolio of whole market. Here, c\\r\\n†\\r\\nis the ‘pseudo-inverse’ of c,\\r\\ndefined as in (3.13). Then, the viability of the whole market can be shown to be equivalent to\\r\\nthe condition\\r\\nG(T) := Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\ng(t)dO(t) < ∞, for all T ≥ 0. (3.52)\\r\\nHere, the adapted nondecreasing process G is called as aggregate maximal growth of whole\\r\\nmarket.\\r\\nWhen the whole market is viable, the growth rates eg of (3.22) and g of (3.51) have simpler\\r\\nforms\\r\\nge =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†αe = γρe, g =\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nα\\r\\n′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α = γρ, (3.53)\\r\\nrespectively, as from (3.26), with ρe := Dec\\r\\n†αe the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among\\r\\nthe top n stocks, and ρ := c\\r\\n†α the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio for the whole market.\\r\\nWe denote the difference of aggregate maximal growth between the whole market and the top n\\r\\nmarket by\\r\\nG := G − Ge =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\ng(t) − ge(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndO(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nγρ(t) − γρe(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndO(t) = Γρ − Γρe. (3.54)\\r\\n30\\nSince ρ is also a growth-optimal portfolio (as a supermartingale num´eraire portfolio) in the whole\\r\\nmarket, the relative growth Γρ\\r\\nρe = Γρe − Γρ of Definition 3.20 is non-increasing, from which we\\r\\nconclude that G is nondecreasing and nonnegative.\\r\\nProposition 3.28. Suppose that the whole market is viable and let ρ and ρe be the supermartin\\x02gale num´eraire portfolio for the whole market and the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio among\\r\\nthe top n stocks, respectively. Then, the asymptotic growth rate of the log-relative wealth process\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρe\\r\\nis the same as −G of (3.54), namely:\\r\\nlim\\r\\nT→∞\\r\\n1\\r\\nG(T)\\r\\nlog \\x12\\r\\nXρe(T)\\r\\nXρ(T)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= −1 holds P − a.e. on the set { lim\\r\\nT→∞\\r\\nG(T) = ∞}. (3.55)\\r\\nProof. We recall the notations (2.28)-(2.32) and write for T ≥ 0,\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρe\\r\\n(T) = log Xρe(T)−log Xρ(T) = Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nγρe(t)−γρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndO(t)+Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nρe(t)−ρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01′\\r\\ndM(t). (3.56)\\r\\nThe first integral on the right-hand side is just −G(T) of (3.54) and it can be rewritten as\\r\\n− G(T) = Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nγρe(t) − γρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndO(t) = 1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nαe\\r\\n′\\r\\nec\\r\\n†αe − α′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n(t)dO(t) (3.57)\\r\\nfrom (3.53). On the other hand, from ρ = c\\r\\n†α and ρe = Dec†αe, we obtain series of equations as\\r\\nin (3.19):\\r\\n(ρe− ρ)\\r\\n′\\r\\nc(ρe− ρ) = ρe\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρe+ ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρ − ρe\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρ − ρ\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρe = αe\\r\\n′ec†αe + α′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α − 2ρe′\\r\\ncρ,\\r\\nas well as\\r\\nρe\\r\\n′\\r\\ncρ = ρe\\r\\n′\\r\\ncc†α = ρe\\r\\n′α = αe′\\r\\n(ec\\r\\n†\\r\\n)\\r\\n′Dα = αe′\\r\\n(ec\\r\\n†\\r\\n)\\r\\n′α. e\\r\\nCombining these equations, we have\\r\\n(ρe− ρ)\\r\\n′\\r\\nc(ρe− ρ) = α\\r\\n′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α − αe′ec†α. e\\r\\nThus, the quadratic variation of the last integral on the right hand-side of (3.56) is written as\\r\\n\\x14 Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nρe(t) − ρ(t)\\r\\n\\x01′\\r\\ndM(t)\\r\\n\\x15\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n(ρe− ρ)\\r\\n′\\r\\nc(ρe− ρ)(t)dO(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n(α\\r\\n′\\r\\nc\\r\\n†α − αe′ec†αe)(t)dO(t) = 2G(T).\\r\\nThe Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz representation (Theorem 3.4.6, Problem 3.4.7 of Karatzas and Shreve\\r\\n(1991)) with the scaling property of Brownian motion implies that there exists a Brownian mo\\x02tion W, on a possibly enlarged filtered probability space, such that\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρe\\r\\n(T) = −G(T) + √\\r\\n2W\\r\\n\\r\\nG(T)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n. (3.58)\\r\\nThe strong law of large numbers for Brownian motion gives the result (3.55).\\r\\nThe expression (3.57) shows that the asymptotic growth rate of the log-relative wealth pro\\x02cess log X\\r\\nρ\\r\\nρe\\r\\nis expressed in terms of ‘local characteristics’ of the market: α, α, c e , and ec.\\r\\n31\\n4 Stock Portfolios in Open Markets\\r\\nThe open market described in the previous section consists of the top n stocks and the money\\r\\nmarket. The existence of this money market gives us a flexibility to construct portfolios among\\r\\ntop n stocks. To be more specific, for any given portfolio π ∈ I(R), multiplying the diagonal\\r\\nmatrix D of (2.47) transforms it into a new portfolio Dπ among top n stocks. The proportion\\r\\nof assets, which is supposed to be invested in ‘bottom’ N − n stocks by π, is now assigned to\\r\\nthe money market by Dπ. In the absence of the money market, building portfolios among top\\r\\nn stocks is more subtle, and this section focuses on these subtleties.\\r\\n4.1 Stock portfolios and the market portfolio\\r\\nAn important subclass of portfolios in Definition 2.5 is the c\\r\\nP\\r\\nollection of portfolios π satisfying\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1 πi ≡ 1, or π0 ≡ 0 in (2.26). Such a portfolio never invests in the money market; and this\\r\\ncondition can be formulated as π ∈ ∆N−1, where we denote\\r\\n∆N−1:= n(x1, · · · , xN ) ∈ R\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nxi = 1o.\\r\\nDefinition 4.1 (Stock Portfolio). We call a portfolio π ∈ I(R) stock portfolio, if it takes values\\r\\nin ∆N−1, i.e., satisfies PN\\r\\ni=1 πi ≡ 1. We denote the collection of stock portfolios by I(R)∩∆N−1\\r\\n.\\r\\nWe call a stock portfolio π stock portfolio among the top n stocks, if in addition it belongs\\r\\nto T (n), i.e., satisfies the condition (2.16), or equivalently, (2.18). We denote the collection of\\r\\nstock portfolios among the top n stocks by I(R) ∩ ∆N−1 ∩ T (n).\\r\\nRemark 4.2 (Self-financibility of stock portfolios). For any stock portfolio π, we sum over (2.25)\\r\\nfor all indices i = 1, · · · , N to obtain\\r\\n1 ≡\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(·) =\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=1 Si(·)ϑi(·)\\r\\nX(·; 1, ϑ)\\r\\n,\\r\\nand from (2.14),\\r\\nX(·; 1, ϑ) = 1 + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(t)dSi(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nϑi(·)Si(·).\\r\\nThis last equation shows the ‘self-financing’ property of the stock portfolios; (see Definition 2.1\\r\\nof Karatzas and Ruf (2017)) the sum of product between the trading strategy ϑi and the stock\\r\\nprice Siis equal to the sum of stochastic integrals of each trading strategy with respect to the\\r\\ncorresponding stock price, along with the initial capital 1, at any time t ≥ 0. There are neither\\r\\nwithdrawals nor infusions of capital from the money market; gains are re-invested, losses are\\r\\nabsorbed.\\r\\nBefore we present the most important example of stock portfolios, we introduce the notation\\r\\nΣ := S1 + · · · + SN , (4.1)\\r\\nrepresenting the total capitalization of whole equity market.\\r\\n32\\nExample 4.3 (Market portfolio). Suppose that an investment strategy ϑ is given as ϑ ≡ 1/Σ(0) ≡\\r\\n(1, 1, · · · , 1)/Σ(0) with initial wealth x = 1. Then, its wealth process is just the total capital\\x02ization normalized by its initial value:\\r\\nX(·; 1, ϑ) = Σ(·)\\r\\nΣ(0). (4.2)\\r\\nWhereas, from (2.25), the corresponding portfolio π ≡ µ ≡ (µ1, · · · , µN ) can be expressed as\\r\\nµi(·) = Si(·)\\r\\nΣ(·)\\r\\n=\\r\\nSi(·)\\r\\nS1(·) + · · · + SN (·)\\r\\n, for i = 1, · · · , N. (4.3)\\r\\nWe call this special stock portfolio µ the market portfolio, and its component processes in (4.3)\\r\\nmarket weights; it is considered as the most important stock portfolio, as its wealth process\\r\\ngives the evolution of total market capitalization.\\r\\nIn an analogous manner, we define the top n market portfolio, which we denote by µe ≡\\r\\n(µe1, · · · , µeN ), with components\\r\\nµei(·) := Sei(·)\\r\\nΣ( e ·)\\r\\n=\\r\\nSei(·)\\r\\nSe1(·) + · · · + SeN (·)\\r\\n, for i = 1, · · · , N, (4.4)\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nΣ := e X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nSei = S(1)+· · ·+S(n), and Sei(·) := 1{ui(·)≤n}Si(·), for i = 1, · · · , N. (4.5)\\r\\nThe denominator Σ of (4.4) represents the sum of the capitalizations of the to e p n stocks; thus,\\r\\nµei(t) is the proportion of the capitalization of stock i, if this stock belongs to the top n, to\\r\\nthe total capitalization of the top n stocks at time t. In other words, µei can be interpreted\\r\\nas the ‘market weight’ of i-th stock in the restricted market composed of the top n stocks by\\r\\ncapitalization. It is easy to check that µe is a stock portfolio among the top n stocks, i.e.,\\r\\nµe ∈ I(R) ∩ ∆N−1 ∩ T (n).\\r\\n4.2 Capital Asset Pricing Model\\r\\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model assumes that individual stocks cannot systematically outper\\x02form the market. In our open market setting, this requirement can be cast as saying that each\\r\\nindividual stock, whenever it belongs to the top n stocks, cannot outperform the top n market.\\r\\nIn this subsection, we briefly discuss this model for the top n market. Recalling the top n stock\\r\\nportfolio µe defined in (4.4), we have the next definition.\\r\\nDefinition 4.4 (CAPM). We say that the top n market is in the realm of the Capital Asset\\r\\nPricing Model (CAPM), if\\r\\nRei =\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)dRµe(t) + Ni, i = 1, · · · , N, (4.6)\\r\\nhold for appropriate processes βi ∈ I(Rµe), i = 1, · · · , N, and for continuous local martingales\\r\\nNi with Ni(0) = 0 which are orthogonal to Rµe for all i = 1, · · · , N:\\r\\n[Ni, Rµe] ≡ 0.\\r\\n33\\nThe following proposition characterizes this property, in terms of the local characteristics of\\r\\nthe top market introduced in Section 2.4.\\r\\nProposition 4.5 (Characterization of CAPM). The top n market is in the realm of the CAPM\\r\\nif, and only if, the following two conditions hold.\\r\\n(A) There exists a scalar “leverage” predictable process b such that\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|b(t)|1{cµeµe>0}|dC eiµe(t)| < ∞, for T ≥ 0, (4.7)\\r\\nand the equalities hold (P ⊗ O)-a.e.:\\r\\nαei = bceiµe, on {cµeµe > 0} for i = 1, · · · , N. (4.8)\\r\\n(B) On the set {cµeµe = 0}, we have (P ⊗ O)-a.e.:\\r\\nαµe = 0 ⇐⇒ αei = 0, i = 1, · · · , N. (4.9)\\r\\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, the process b of (4.7) and the processes βi ∈ I(Rµe) of (4.6)\\r\\ncan be chosen, respectively, as\\r\\nb =\\r\\nαµe\\r\\ncµeµe\\r\\n1{cµeµe>0}, (4.10)\\r\\nβi =\\r\\nceiµe\\r\\ncµeµe\\r\\n1{cµeµe>0} +\\r\\nαei\\r\\nαµe\\r\\n1{cµeµe=0, αµe6=0}, i = 1, · · · , N. (4.11)\\r\\nProof. Let us assume first that the top n market is in the realm of the CAPM. Recalling the\\r\\nnotation (2.46), we have\\r\\nC eiµe = [Rei, Rµe] = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)d[Rµe, Rµe](t) + [Ni, Rµe] = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)dCµeµe(t),\\r\\nwhich implies that ceiµe = βicµeµe also hold (P ⊗ O)-a.e., for i = 1, · · · , N. On {cµeµe > 0}, it follows\\r\\nthat βi = ceiµe/cµeµe for i = 1, · · · , N. Moreover, since Rei −\\r\\nR ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)dRµe(t) is a local martingale,\\r\\nwe obtain Aei =\\r\\nR ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)dAµe(t), and also αei = βiαµe holds (P ⊗ O)-a.e. for i = 1, · · · , N. As a\\r\\nconsequence, the identities of (4.8)\\r\\nαei =\\r\\nαµe\\r\\ncµeµe\\r\\nceiµe = bceiµe, hold for i = 1, · · · , N, (P ⊗ O) − a.e. on {cµeµe > 0},\\r\\nwith b given as in (4.10). Also, the (P ⊗ O)-a.e. identities αei = βiαµe, combined with αµe =\\r\\nµe\\r\\n′α, lead to the condition (B). Finally, b = αei/ceiµe\\r\\non {cµeµe > 0, ceiµe6= 0} implies that\\r\\n|b|1{cµeµe>0}|ceiµe| ≤ |αei| hold for i = 1, · · · , N, and thus the condition (4.7):\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|b(t)|1{cµeµe>0}|dC eiµe(t)| ≤ X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|dAei(t)| < ∞, for all T ≥ 0.\\r\\n34\\nConversely, suppose that the conditions (A) and (B) are valid. For i = 1, · · · , N, defining βi\\r\\nvia (4.11), we have\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|βi(t)||dAµe(t)| ≤ Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|b(t)|1{cµeµe>0}|dC eiµe(t)| +\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|dAei(t)| < ∞,\\r\\nas well as\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|βi(t)|\\r\\n2\\r\\ndCµeµe(t) = Z T\\r\\n0\\r\\n|ceiµe(t)|\\r\\n2\\r\\ncµeµe(t)\\r\\n1{cµeµe>0}dO(t) ≤\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\ncei,ei(t)dO(t) = Cei,i(T) < ∞.\\r\\nThese inequalities imply that βi ∈ I(Rµe) for i = 1, · · · , N. Furthermore, recalling the semi\\x02martingale decomposition (2.35), we observe that\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)dRµe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)µe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dAe(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)µe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)1{cµeµe(t)>0}b(t)dCµeµe(t) + Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)1{cµeµe(t)=0}µe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dAe(t) (4.12)\\r\\n+\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)µe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dMf(t),\\r\\nfrom (4.10). The first two integrals on the right hand side of (4.12) can be expressed as\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)1{cµeµe(t)>0}b(t)dCµeµe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{cµeµe(t)>0}b(t)dC eiµe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{cµeµe(t)>0}dAei(t),\\r\\nand\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nβi(t)1{cµeµe(t)=0}µe\\r\\n′\\r\\n(t)dAe(t) = Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1{cµeµe(t)=0}dAei(t),\\r\\nfor i = 1, · · · , N, on account of (4.11).

Given a function\\r\\nG : ∆N−1\\r\\n+ → (0,∞) of class C2 with the notation\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1\\r\\n+ := ∆N−1 ∩ R\\r\\nN\\r\\n+ =\\r\\nn\\r\\n(x1, · · · , xN ) ∈ R\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c xi ≥ 0 for i = 1, · · · , N, X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nxi = 1o, (4.13)\\r\\n35\\nwe can generate a portfolio π\\r\\nG from G, depending on the vector of market weights µ. The\\r\\nformula (11.2) of Fernholz and Karatzas (2009), colloquially known as the ‘master formula’, gives\\r\\na simply way to compare the relative wealth process of π\\r\\nG with respect to the ‘market’, namely,\\r\\nthe market portfolio µ (see, Chapter III of Fernholz and Karatzas (2009) for an overview).\\r\\nIn what follows, we present a new way to generate portfolios from a function having the\\r\\nmarket portfolio among the top n stocks µe in (4.4) as its input. We also derive a new ‘master\\r\\nformula’ to compare the wealth of the so-generated portfolio, relative to µe, the market portfolio\\r\\namong the top n stocks.\\r\\nFor any stock portfolio π ∈ I(R)∩∆N−1, we have π0 ≡ 0 (no investing in the money market),\\r\\nthus\\r\\ndXµe\\r\\nπ (t)\\r\\nX\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ (t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)dRµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\ndSµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t), (4.14)\\r\\nfrom (3.9). Here, we recall from (3.2) that S\\r\\nµe\\r\\nis the vector of stock prices denominated by the\\r\\nwealth process Xµe of the market portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nWe note at this point, that the market portfolio µ in Example 4.3, has a very nice property:\\r\\nthe denominated stock price S\\r\\nµ\\r\\ni\\r\\nhas a simple representation, namely S\\r\\nµ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(·) = Σ(0)µi(·), for\\r\\ni = 1, · · · , N. Thus, if we used µ instead of µe in deriving (4.14), the last integrator would be\\r\\nrewritten as dSµ\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) = Σ(0)dµi(t). However, unlike µ, the components of µe in (4.4) do not admit\\r\\nsuch a simple representation. For this reason, we will use the denominated stock price S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nas integrators, and will let the generating function G depend on S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) instead of µei(t) in what\\r\\nfollows.\\r\\nFor a given function G : (0,∞)\\r\\nN → (0,∞) of class C2\\r\\n, we want to write the relative-log\\r\\nwealth as\\r\\nlog X\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t) = log \\x12\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(0)\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n+ J\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t), for any t ≥ 0, (4.15)\\r\\nfor some function J\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ (·) of finite variation. In order to find J\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ (·), we apply Itˆo’s rule, to obtain\\r\\ndXµe\\r\\nπ (t)\\r\\nX\\r\\nµe\\r\\nπ (t)\\r\\n= dJµe\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t) +X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nDiG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 dSµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) + 1\\r\\n2\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nD2\\r\\ni,jG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 d[S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n, Sµe\\r\\nj\\r\\n](t). (4.16)\\r\\nComparing the two equations (4.14) and (4.16), suppose we can find a portfolio π such that\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(t)\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\ndSµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nDiG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 dSµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t), (4.17)\\r\\nholds, then we have\\r\\ndJµe\\r\\nπ\\r\\n(t) = −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nD2\\r\\ni,jG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 d[S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n, Sµe\\r\\nj\\r\\n](t).\\r\\nNow, a candidate portfolio π satisfying (4.17), is given as\\r\\nπi(t) = S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nDiG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 , i = 1, · · · , N;\\r\\n36\\nbut it need not belong to ∆N−1\\r\\n.

Let G : (0,∞)\\r\\nN → (0,∞) be a twice con\\x02tinuously differentiable function. Then, the vector π\\r\\nG ≡ π = (π1, · · · , πN ) defined as in (4.18)\\r\\nis called the stock portfolio generated by the function G via the market portfolio among the top\\r\\nn stocks.\\r\\nProposition 4.7 (Master Formula). For the stock portfolio π\\r\\nG generated by G with the market\\r\\nportfolio among the top n stocks, we have the decomposition\\r\\nlog \\x12\\r\\nXπG\\r\\nXµe\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= log \\x12\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(0)\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nD2\\r\\ni,jG\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nµe\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nSµe(t)\\r\\n\\x01 d[S\\r\\nµe\\r\\ni\\r\\n, Sµe\\r\\nj\\r\\n](t). (4.19)\\r\\nThe above arguments, leading to Definition 4.6 and Proposition 4.7, have two weaknesses.\\r\\nFirst, the functionally-generated stock portfolio π\\r\\nG in (4.18) is not generally a portfolio among\\r\\nthe top n stocks, i.e., it can fail to belong to T (n). Thus, the Master formula (4.19) compares a\\r\\nportfolio π\\r\\nG which is not a portfolio among the top n stocks, with µe, which is a portfolio among\\r\\nthe top n stocks. We will fix this issue by restricting the class of generating functions G in the\\r\\nnext subsection.\\r\\nSecondly, when we construct a portfolio via (4.18) or use the Master formula (4.19), we need\\r\\nto know at each time t ≥ 0 the entire history of the process Xµe, up to time t, because these\\r\\nequations require the values of the vector S\\r\\nµe = S/Xµe. This issue is unfortunately inevitable in\\r\\nthe open market, because of its own nature of µe; as it is composed of the top n stocks, we need\\r\\nto keep track of the ranks of N stocks all the time, whereas computing the wealth Xµ generated\\r\\nby the market portfolio µ only requires current stock prices (and the stock prices at time t = 0),\\r\\nfrom its simple representation (4.2). Though we cannot resolve this second issue, we will give a\\r\\nrepresentation of Xµe in the following subsection.\\r\\n37\\n4.4 Functionally generated portfolios using ranks\\r\\nRecalling the rank notation in Definition 2.2, we define the random permutation process pk(t)\\r\\nof {1, · · · , N} such that for k = 1, · · · , N,\\r\\nSpk(t)(t) = S(k)(t), (4.20)\\r\\npk(t) < pk+1(t) if S(k)(t) = S(k+1)(t).\\r\\npk(t) represents the index name of the stock at rank k at time t, breaking ties with the lexico\\x02graphic rule, so it is the inverse permutation of ui(t), introduced in (2.4): ui(t) = k ⇐⇒ pk(t) = i,\\r\\nfor all t ≥ 0.\\r\\nFor any continuous semimartingale Y , we denote the local time accumulated at the origin\\r\\nby Y (·) up to time t ≥ 0 by L\\r\\nY\\r\\n(t);\\r\\nL\\r\\nY\\r\\n(t) := 1\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\x12\\r\\n|Y (t)| − |Y (0)| − Z t\\r\\n0\\r\\nsignY (s)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\ndY (s)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n, where sign(x) = 2 × 1(0,∞)(x) − 1.\\r\\nThen, L\\r\\nS(k)−S(ℓ) (t) can be interpreted as the ‘collision local time’ accumulated up to time t,\\r\\nwhenever the k-th and ℓ-th ranked processes of S collide. In order to simplify the local time terms\\r\\nthroughout this section, we introduce the following definition which prohibits the accumulation\\r\\nof local times of ‘triple collisions’ between the stock prices.\\r\\nDefinition 4.8. The components of the price vector S = (S1, · · · , SN ) in Definition 2.1 are\\r\\ncalled pathwise mutually nondegenerate, if\\r\\n(i) the set {t : Si(t) = Sj (t)} has Lebesgue measure zero, P-a.e., for all i 6= j; and if\\r\\n(ii) L\\r\\nS(k)−S(ℓ) (t) ≡ 0 holds P-a.e., for |k − ℓ| ≥ 2.\\r\\nProposition 4.9. Suppose that the components of the price vector S are pathwise mutually non\\x02degenerate. Then, with the notation (4.5), the wealth process Xµe of µe admits the representation\\r\\nXµe(·) = Σ( e ·)\\r\\nΣ(0) e\\r\\nexp \\x12−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\n1\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\ndLS(n)−S(n+1) (t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n. (4.21)\\r\\nProof. From Proposition 3.1 and the fact that µe is a stock portfolio, we have\\r\\nXµe(·) = E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nµei(t)dRi(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nSei(t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)Si(t)\\r\\ndSi(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\n1{ui(t)=k}\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\ndSi(t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n.\\r\\nOn the other hand, from Proposition 4.1.11 of Fernholz (2002), we have\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n1{ui(t)=k}dSi(t) = dS(k)(t) −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\ndLS(k)−S(k+1) (t) + 1\\r\\n2\\r\\ndLS(k−1)−S(k) (t),\\r\\nfor k = 1, · · · , N and t ≥ 0, with the conventions L\\r\\nS(0)−S(1) ≡ 0 and LS(N)−S(N+1) ≡ 0. Thus, we\\r\\nobtain\\r\\nXµe(·) = E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\ndS(k)(t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\ndLS(k−1)−S(k) (t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\ndLS(k)−S(k+1) (t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x10 Z ·\\r\\n0\\r\\ndΣ( e t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\ndLS(n)−S(n+1) (t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n=\\r\\nΣ( e ·)\\r\\nΣ(0) e\\r\\nexp \\x12−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\ndLS(n)−S(n+1) (t)\\r\\nΣ( e t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n.\\r\\n38\\nThe exponential term of (4.21) shows the ‘leakage’, the effect caused by stocks which cross\\r\\nover from the top n league to the bottom. Due to this effect, we need to keep track of the\\r\\ncollision local time L\\r\\nS(n)−S(n+1) in order to compute Xµe, as we pointed out at the end of the\\r\\nprevious subsection.\\r\\nWe next present Fernholz’s original method of constructing rank-dependent portfolios from\\r\\ngenerating functions. We write µ(k)to represent the k-th ranked market weight among µ1, · · · , µN\\r\\nfor k = 1, · · · , N, and introduce the vector µ = (µ(1), · · · , µ(N)) with components µ(k) = S(k)/Σ,\\r\\nk = 1, · · · , N, as in (2.2), (4.1). The following result is based on Theorem 4.2.1 of Fernholz\\r\\n(2002).\\r\\nTheorem 4.10 (Functionally generated portfolios using ranked market weights). Suppose that\\r\\nthe price vector S is pathwise mutually nondegenerate. Let pk(·), k = 1, · · · , N be the random\\r\\npermutation process defined by (4.20) and let G be a function defined on a neighborhood U of\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1\\r\\n+ . Suppose that there exists a positive C\\r\\n2\\r\\nfunction G such that for (x1, · · · , xN ) ∈ U,\\r\\nG(x1, · · · , xN ) = G(x(1), · · · , x(N)). (4.22)\\r\\nThen G generates the stock portfolio π\\r\\nG such that for k = 1, · · · , N,\\r\\nπ\\r\\nG\\r\\npk(t)\\r\\n(t) = \\x12\\r\\nDkG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 + 1 −\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nℓ=1\\r\\nµ(ℓ)\\r\\nDℓG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\nµ(k)(t), for t ≥ 0. (4.23)\\r\\nThe log-relative wealth process of π\\r\\nG with respect to the market portfolio µ, can be expressed via\\r\\nthe ‘master formula’ :\\r\\nlog \\x12\\r\\nXπG\\r\\nXµ\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= log \\x12\\r\\nG(µ)\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(0)\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nN\\r\\nX−1\\r\\nk=1\\r\\n\\x12π\\r\\nG\\r\\npk(t)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nµ(k)(t)\\r\\n−\\r\\nπ\\r\\nG\\r\\npk+1(t)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nµ(k+1)(t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\ndLµ(k)−µ(k+1) (t)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\nℓ=1\\r\\nD2\\r\\nk,ℓG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 d[µ(k)\\r\\n, µ(ℓ)](t).\\r\\nThe portfolio π\\r\\nG generated via the recipe (4.23) is easily checked to be a stock portfolio, i.e.,\\r\\nπ\\r\\nG ∈ I(R) ∩ ∆N−1\\r\\n; however, it is not generally a portfolio among the top n stocks. In order to\\r\\nmake it a portfolio among the top n stocks, we need to impose two conditions on the function\\r\\nG in Theorem 4.10:\\r\\n(A) G is ‘balanced’, i.e., satisfies the identity\\r\\nG(x1, · · · , xN ) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\nj=1\\r\\nxjDjG(x1, · · · , xN ), for any x ∈ U, (4.24)\\r\\n(B) G(x) depends only on the first n components of x.\\r\\nIf the condition (A) is satisfied, then the portfolio π\\r\\nG of (4.23) has a simpler representation as\\r\\nπ\\r\\nG\\r\\npk(t)\\r\\n(t) = DkG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 µ(k)\\r\\n(t), for t ≥ 0. (4.25)\\r\\nMoreover, if the condition (B) holds as well, then DkG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n= 0 for k > n, thus π\\r\\nG\\r\\npk(t)\\r\\n(t) = 0 for\\r\\nk > n. This means that the portfolio π\\r\\nG does not invest in the i = pk(t)-th stock at time t, if\\r\\nthe rank k of this i-th stock is bigger than n at time t.\\r\\n39\\nDefinition 4.11 (Admissible generating function in open market). We call a function G in\\r\\nTheorem 4.10 an admissible generating function of market consisting of the top n stocks, if it\\r\\nsatisfies conditions (A) and (B) above.\\r\\nCorollary 4.12. If G in Theorem 4.10 is an admissible generating function of market consisting\\r\\nof top n stocks, then G generates the stock portfolio among the top n stocks π\\r\\nG ∈ I(R)∩T (n)∩\\r\\n∆N−1, given as (4.25) for k = 1, · · · , N. In this case, we have the master formula\\r\\nlog \\x12\\r\\nXπG\\r\\nXµ\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= log \\x12\\r\\nG(µ)\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(0)\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\n\\x12\\r\\nDkG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 −\\r\\nDk+1G\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\ndLµ(k)−µ(k+1) (t)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ ·\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nXn\\r\\nℓ=1\\r\\nD2\\r\\nk,ℓG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nµ(t)\\r\\n\\x01 d[µ(k)\\r\\n, µ(ℓ)](t). (4.26)\\r\\nExample 4.13 (Balanced functions). By solving the partial differential equation of (4.24), a\\r\\nbalanced function G can be shown to be homogeneous of degree 1, i.e, the identity\\r\\nG(ax) = aG(x) (4.27)\\r\\nholds for any x ∈ U and a > 0. From this simple characterization of balanced functions, we\\r\\nillustrate three types of balanced functions here:\\r\\n(i) G(x) = 1\\r\\nc1+···+cN\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=1 cixi\\r\\n,\\r\\n(ii) G(x) =  QN\\r\\ni=1 xi\\r\\n\\x011/N\\r\\n,\\r\\n(iii) G(x) = PN\\r\\ni=1 x\\r\\np\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\x01 1\\r\\np\\r\\n.\\r\\nThese functions are closely related to ‘three Pythagorean means’; (i) and (ii) are just the\\r\\nweighted-arithmetic and geometric means of the components of x, and (iii) becomes the har\\x02monic mean when p = −1. A plethora of examples of these types can be found in the literature.\\r\\nThe “capitalization-weighted portfolios” of large and small stocks from Example 6.2, Example\\r\\n6.3 of Karatzas and Ruf (2017), or from Example 4.3.2 of Fernholz (2002) are special cases of\\r\\n(i). The “equal-weighted portfolio”, which holds equal weights across all assets, in Section 4.3\\r\\nof Karatzas and Ruf (2017), is generated by (ii). The portfolio generated by (iii) for 0 < p < 1\\r\\nis called “diversity-weighted portfolio”, and is discussed in detail in Example 3.4.4 and Section\\r\\n6.2 of Fernholz (2002). Diversity-weighted portfolios with negative parameter p < 0 in (iii) are\\r\\nthe main subject of Vervuurt and Karatzas (2015).\\r\\nWe can slightly generalize and make these functions satisfy conditions (A) and (B) as well:\\r\\n(i’) G(x) = Pn\\r\\ni=1 cixi\\r\\n,\\r\\n(ii’) G(x) = Qn\\r\\ni=1 x\\r\\nci\\r\\ni\\r\\n, with Pn\\r\\ni=1 ci = 1,\\r\\n(iii’) G(x) = \\x10Pn\\r\\ni=1 x\\r\\np\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\x11 1\\r\\np\\r\\n,\\r\\nfor some constants ci’s and p.\\r\\n40\\nThe following example further devolops Example 4.3.2 of Fernholz (2002), and shows that\\r\\nthe top n market portfolio µe, defined in (4.4), can be generated functionally.\\r\\nExample 4.14 (Top n market portfolio). Consider the function\\r\\nG(x) = G(x(1), · · · , x(n)) = Xn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nx(k)\\r\\nsatisfying the conditions (A) and (B) above.

In the open market setting, since we only consider portfolios\\r\\namong the top n stocks, it is more appropriate to compare a portfolio’s performance with respect\\r\\nto µe, rather than µ.

This portfolio\\r\\nwas first introduced by Cover (1991) in discrete time, and its extension to continuous time was\\r\\ndeveloped by Jamshidian (1992). More recent work under the setting of Stochastic Portfolio\\r\\nTheory can be found in Cuchiero et al. (2019).\\r\\nRecalling the notation ∆N−1\\r\\n+ from (4.13), we need first the following notation\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ := \\x08\\r\\nx ∈ R\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\nxk ≥ 0 for k = 1, · · · , N, Xn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nxk = 1, xn+1 = · · · = xN = 0\\t(4.31)\\r\\nthroughout this subsection. Since we are only allowed to invest in the top n stocks in an open\\r\\nmarket, the notion of Cover’s ‘constant rebalanced portfolio’ needs to be amended, as follows.\\r\\nDefinition 4.17 (constant rebalanced portfolio by rank). If a stock portfolio π ∈ I(R)∩T (n)∩\\r\\n∆N−1 among the top n stocks satisfies\\r\\nπpk(t)(t) = ξk for t ≥ 0, k = 1, · · · , N (4.32)\\r\\nwith some ξ = (ξ1, · · · , ξN ) ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ , we call π a constant rebalanced portfolio among the top n\\r\\nstocks by rank. This portfolio re-balances at all times to maintain a constant proportion ξk of\\r\\ncurrent wealth invested in the k-th ranked stock, for k ≤ n. We denote the collection of constant\\r\\nrebalanced portfolios among the top n stocks by CRn.\\r\\nProposition 4.18. Every constant rebalanced portfolio among the top n stocks by rank is func\\x02tionally generated.\\r\\n42\\nProof. For a fixed ξ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ , consider a function\\r\\nG(x) = G(x(1), · · · , x(N)) = Yn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nx\\r\\nξk\\r\\n(k)\\r\\n. (4.33)\\r\\nIt is easy to check that G is an admissible generating function of market consisting of the top n\\r\\nstocks, and it generates the portfolio via the recipe (4.25):\\r\\nπ\\r\\nG\\r\\npk(t)\\r\\n(t) = ξk, for t ≥ 0, k = 1, · · · , N.\\r\\nSince ξ is chosen arbitrarily from ∆N−1,n\\r\\n+ , the claim follows.\\r\\nThanks to Proposition 4.18, for every ξ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ there exists a corresponding portfolio\\r\\nπ ∈ CRnas in Definition 4.17, and we write Xξ(t) to represent the wealth process of π at time\\r\\nt in the manner of (2.22), namely,\\r\\nXξ(t) ≡ Xπ(t) = E\\r\\n\\x12 Z t\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπi(s)dRi(s)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\n= E\\r\\n\\x12Xn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nξk\\r\\nZ t\\r\\n0\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n1{ui(s)=k}dRi(s)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\nfor t ≥ 0.\\r\\n(4.34)\\r\\nFor T > 0 fixed, we define\\r\\nX∗(T) := sup\\r\\nπ∈CRn\\r\\nXπ(T) = sup\\r\\nξ∈∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(T). (4.35)\\r\\nThis X∗(T) represents the maximal wealth at time T, achievable over all constant rebalanced\\r\\nportfolios among the top n stocks by rank. We show in the following that a F(T)-measurable\\r\\nrandom vector of weights π\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(T) ≡ ξ\\r\\n∗\\r\\nexists, which attains the supremum in (4.35), namely, that\\r\\nX∗(T) = Xπ∗(T)(T) = Xξ\\r\\n∗ (T) holds.\\r\\nLemma 4.19. For a fixed T > 0, the mapping ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ ∋ ξ 7→ Xξ(T) ∈ R is continuous.\\r\\nProof. For ξ, ζ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ , we have\\r\\nlog Xξ(T) − log Xζ (T) = log Xξ(T)\\r\\nXµe(T)\\r\\n− log Xζ (T)\\r\\nXµe(T)\\r\\n=\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nlog \\x12\\r\\nµ(k)(T)\\r\\nµ(k)(0) \\x13(ξk−ζk)\\r\\n(4.36)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn−1\\r\\nk=1\\r\\n\\x12\\r\\nξk − ζk\\r\\nµ(k)(t)\\r\\n−\\r\\nξk+1 − ζk+1\\r\\nµ(k+1)(t)\\r\\n\\x13\\r\\ndLµ(k)−µ(k+1) (t) −\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\nξn − ζn\\r\\nµ(n)(t)\\r\\ndLµ(n)−µ(n+1) (t)\\r\\n−\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nXn\\r\\nℓ=1\\r\\nξkξℓ − ζkζℓ\\r\\nµ(k)(t)µ(ℓ)(t)\\r\\nd[µ(k), µ(ℓ)](t) + 1\\r\\n2\\r\\nZ T\\r\\n0\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nξkζk\\r\\nµ\\r\\n2\\r\\n(k)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\nd[µ(k), µ(k)](t).\\r\\nIn the last equality, we used the master formula (4.29) twice, and applied it to the functions of the\\r\\nform (4.33) for ξ and ζ, respectively. Since the functions µ(k)(·), Lµ(k)−µ(k+1) (·), [µ(k), µ(ℓ)](·)\\r\\nfor 1 ≤ k, ℓ ≤ n on the right-hand side (4.36) are all continuous, they are bounded on the\\r\\ncompact interval [0, T]. Thus, we obtain the estimate\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\nlog Xξ(T) − log Xζ (T)\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\x0c ≤ ||ξ − ζ||KT for\\r\\nsome positive constant KT , which depends on min0≤t≤T µ(k)(t), Lµ(k)−µ(k+1) (T), [µ(k)\\r\\n, µ(k)](T)\\r\\nfor k = 1, · · · , n, and this proves the continuity.\\r\\n43\\nDefinition 4.20 (Best retrospectively chosen vector of weights). The continuity shown in\\r\\nLemma 4.19 shows that there exists a vector ξ\\r\\n∗ ≡ π∗\\r\\n(T) ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ which attains the supremum\\r\\nin (4.35) for a fixed T ∈ (0,∞). We call this F(T)-measurable, ∆N−1,n\\r\\n+ -valued random variable\\r\\nπ\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(T) the best retrospectively chosen vector of weights among the top n stocks for the given\\r\\nT ∈ (0,∞).\\r\\nEven though π\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(T) meant to outperform all constant rebalanced portfolios among the top\\r\\nn stocks by rank at T > 0, constructing it requires the knowledge of stock prices over the entire\\r\\ninterval [0, T], that is, ahead of time. Cover (1991) introduced a remarkable way to construct\\r\\na portfolio, called “universal portfolio”, depending only on past stock prices, whose long-run\\r\\nperformance is almost as good as that of the best retrospectively chosen vector of weights.\\r\\nCover’s idea of building the universal portfolio, was to determine its weights by averaging the\\r\\nperformances of all constant portfolio weights, at any time t ≥ 0.\\r\\nDefinition 4.21 (universal portfolio). With the notation ∆N−1,n\\r\\n+ of (4.31), the portfolio ˆπ,\\r\\ndefined as\\r\\nπˆpk(t)(t) :=\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nξkXξ(t)dξ\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(t)dξ for t ≥ 0, k = 1, · · · , N, (4.37)\\r\\nis called universal portfolio among the top n stocks.\\r\\nFrom the notation ∆N−1,n\\r\\n+ , we have ˆπpk(t)\\r\\n(t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0 for k > n; i.e., ˆπ invests only\\r\\nin the top n stocks, thus it belongs to I(R) ∩ T (n) ∩ ∆N−1, the collections of stock portfolios\\r\\namong the top n stocks. We next compute the wealth of the universal portfolio.\\r\\nProposition 4.22. The wealth process Xπˆ is given as\\r\\nXπˆ(t) =\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(t)dξ\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\ndξ , for t ≥ 0. (4.38)\\r\\nProof. Let Z(t) denote the right-hand side of (4.38). We have\\r\\ndZ(t)\\r\\nZ(t)\\r\\n=\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\ndXξ(t)dξ\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(t)dξ =\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(t)\\r\\nPN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nPn\\r\\nk=1 ξk1{ui(t)=k}dRi(t)dξ\\r\\nR\\r\\n∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nXξ(t)dξ\\r\\n=\\r\\nX\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nXn\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nπˆpk(t)(t)1{ui(t)=k}dRi(t) = X\\r\\nN\\r\\ni=1\\r\\nπˆi(t)dRi(t) = dXπˆ(t)\\r\\nXπˆ(t)\\r\\n.\\r\\nHere, the second, third and last equalities are from (4.34), (4.37), and (2.22), respectively. Since\\r\\nXπˆ(0) = Z(0) = 1, the result follows.\\r\\nWe are now ready to compare the long-run performance of the universal portfolio with the\\r\\nbest retrospectively chosen vector of weights.\\r\\nTheorem 4.23. Suppose that the portfolio µ, defined in (4.3), satisfies\\r\\nµ(1)(t) ≥ · · · ≥ µ(n)(t) ≥ δ, for all t ≥ 0 for some δ > 0, (4.39)\\r\\n44\\nlim sup\\r\\nT→∞\\r\\n1\\r\\nT\\r\\n[µ(k), µ(k)](T) < ∞, lim sup\\r\\nT→∞\\r\\n1\\r\\nT\\r\\nL\\r\\nµ(k)−µ(k+1) (T) < ∞, for k = 1, · · · , n. (4.40)\\r\\nThen, the best retrospectively chosen vector of weights and the universal portfolio have the same\\r\\nasymptotic growth rate; that is,\\r\\nlim\\r\\nT→∞\\r\\n1\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\nlog Xπ∗(T)(T) − log Xπˆ(T)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n= 0, (4.41)\\r\\nwhere π\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(T) and πˆ are as in Definitions 4.20 and 4.21, respectively.\\r\\nProof. Since Xπ∗(T)(T) ≥ Xξ(T) holds for every ξ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ for every T ≥ 0, the inequality “≥”\\r\\nof (4.41) is obvious from (4.38).\\r\\nWe now show the reverse inequality. Let ξ\\r\\n∗ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ be the corresponding vector of weights\\r\\nπ\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(T) as in Definition 4.20. For any ξ ∈ ∆\\r\\nN−1,n\\r\\n+ satisfying ||ξ\\r\\n∗ −ξ|| ≤ η for some η > 0, we have\\r\\nthe estimate\\r\\n1\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\x10\\r\\nlog Xξ(T) − log Xξ\\r\\n∗ (T)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n≥ −\\r\\nη\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\x10an\\r\\nδ\\r\\nmax\\r\\n1≤k≤n\\r\\nL\\r\\nµ(k)−µ(k+1) (T) + bn\\r\\nδ\\r\\n2 max\\r\\n1≤k≤n\\r\\n[µ(k), µ(k)](T)\\r\\n\\x11\\r\\n=: −\\r\\nη\\r\\nT\\r\\nKT ,\\r\\nin the same manner as in the proof of Lemma 4.19, for some positive constants an and bn\\r\\ndepending on n. Due to the condition (4.40), we can take η sufficiently small such that η\\r\\nT KT ≤ ǫ\\r\\nholds for every T ≥ 1, for any given ǫ > 0.

Here, B(ξ\\r\\n∗\\r\\n, η) is the intersection of ∆N−1,n\\r\\n+\\r\\nand || · ||-ball in R\\r\\nN centered at ξ∗ with radius η.

Taking logarithms, then letting T → ∞ for any given\\r\\nǫ > 0, the desired inequality follows.\\r\\n45\\n5 Conclusion\\r\\nMost of the results in Section 3, including the main Theorem 3.19, a foundational result of\\r\\nequity market structure and of the study of arbitrage in open markets, can be formulated quite\\r\\nsimply in terms of the local characteristics αe and ec of the open market, defined in (2.40), (2.41).\\r\\nIn particular, the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio ρ in the top n open market, if it exists,\\r\\nshould satisfy the equation αe = ecρ of (3.11). From this equation, we were able to conclude\\r\\nthat the supermartingale num´eraire portfolio ρ in the open market takes the form of ρ = Dec\\r\\n†αe.\\r\\nHere, multiplying by the diagonal matrix D of (2.47) makes the portfolio invest only in the top\\r\\nn stocks, while maintaining its supermartingale num´eraire property.\\r\\nHowever, as foretold in the introductory part of Section 4, we cannot use this technique to\\r\\ndeal with stock portfolios; multiplying by D a stock portfolio in order to make it invest only\\r\\nin the top n stocks, destroys its self-financing property. For example, a unit vector π := e\\r\\n1 =\\r\\n(1, 0, · · · , 0) is a stock portfolio which invests all capital into the first stock, but Dπ is not a stock\\r\\nportfolio as it invests all wealth into the money market whenever the first stock fails to belong\\r\\nto the top n market. Thus, for stock portfolios in open markets, a different approach is offered.\\r\\nFernholz’s functional generation of stock portfolios with ranked market weights, under the extra\\r\\nconditions (A) and (B) of Definition 4.11, provides a systematic way to construct stock portfolios\\r\\nthat invest only in the top n open market. This approach also yields the ‘master formula’ in\\r\\nCorollary (4.15), which allows comparing these portfolios with the top n market portfolio, µe.\\r\\nAs an application of this formula, we could prove that Cover’s result on the universal portfolio\\r\\nis also valid in open markets.\\r\\nNonetheless, there are a lot of limitations when considering stock portfolios in open markets.\\r\\nFirst, the balance condition (4.24) significantly restricts the class of generating functions in\\r\\nopen markets. Moreover, the local time terms which appear on the right-hand side of the\\r\\nmaster formula (4.29), make it very difficult to find stock portfolios in open markets which\\r\\noutperform µe. These difficulties are an inevitable price to pay for dealing with stock portfolios\\r\\nin open markets.\\r\\n46\\nReferences\\r\\nBanner, A. D. and Ghomrasni, R. (2008).

Practitioners may also want to mimic more time series from their limited collection of\\r\\nreal data such as sales records for new products and health metrics for a rare disease. Therefore,\\r\\nefficient generation of time series with target features of interest is another important problem\\r\\nto address. For a review of the relevant literature, see Kang et al. (2017).\\r\\nKang et al. (2017) use a genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve time series of length n that project\\r\\nto the target feature point F˜ in the two-dimensional instance space as closely as possible. At\\r\\neach iteration of the GA, a combination of selection, crossover and mutation is applied over\\r\\nthe corresponding population to optimize the n points of the time series to be evolved. The\\r\\ncomputational complexity grows linearly as the length of time series increases. We document\\r\\nthe details of the genetic algorithm in Appendix A.4.', \"The main topic discussed in this chunk is the efficiency analysis and computational time comparison of the GRATIS algorithm with existing methods, specifically Kang et al. (2017). The comparison highlights the GRATIS algorithm's speedup in generating time series with controllable features, with a significant reduction in computational time for longer time series lengths. This information relates to the overall theme of developing efficient algorithms for generating synthetic time series data.\\n\\nfittest individual to improve the average fitness value of each generation.\\r\\n4. Keep the time series that is closest to the target feature point (i.e., has the largest fitness\\r\\nvalue) to be the newly generated time series for the corresponding target.\\r\\nOne may want to mimic very short time series. In principle, GRATIS could be equally\\r\\nwell used if the features of target series are available. Nonetheless, if the feature calculation\\r\\ninvolves lagged values, the length of time series should be at least greater than the length of\\r\\nlags. Besides, expert information can be also provided through the settings in Table 1, which is\\r\\nparticularly useful when one has very limited historical data or one is interested in a particular\\r\\nsetting of features.\\r\\n4.2 Efficiency analysis\\r\\nTable 6 shows the computational time for generating different time series with different sets of\\r\\nfeatures. Lengths are chosen in the same way as for Table 2. The target feature vectors used\\r\\nare median values of the selected features of the simulated data with the same seasonal pattern\\r\\nand similar lengths. The algorithm used in Kang et al. (2017) takes about 22,000 seconds to\\r\\nevolve 100 time series of length 100 with 6 features. For this similar task, but with twice as\\r\\nmany features, our algorithm is about 40 times faster on average. This speedup allows us to\\r\\ngenerate time series with controllable features in a reasonable time.\\r\\n20\\nTable 6: Computational time (in seconds) for generation of 100 yearly, quarterly, monthly and\\r\\nweekly time series.

Therefore, it can be viewed\\r\\nas a basis for many future extensions. To give some ideas, recall that most\\r\\nof the model parameters were assumed constant over time. It is intuitively\\r\\nreasonable, however, that these parameters behave differently during differ\\x02ent time intervals of the question.

This\\r\\nis by no means restricted to the study of bias or its relation to self-reported\\r\\nexpertise. Different parameter dependencies could be constructed based on\\r\\nmany other expert characteristics, such as gender, education or specialty,\\r\\nto produce a range of novel insights on the forecasting behavior of experts.\\r\\nIt would also be useful to know how expert characteristics interact with\\r\\nquestion types, such as economic, domestic or international. The results\\r\\nwould be of interest to the decision-maker who could use the information as\\r\\na basis for hiring only a high-performing subset of the available experts.\\r\\nOther future directions could remove some of the obvious limitations of\\r\\nour model. For instance, recall that the random components are assumed\\r\\nto follow a normal distribution. This is a strong assumption that may not\\r\\nalways be justified. Logit probabilities, however, have been modeled with the\\r\\nnormal distribution before [see, e.g., Erev, Wallsten and Budescu (1994)].\\r\\nFurthermore, the normal distribution is a rather standard assumption in\\r\\npsychological models [see, e.g., signal-detection theory in Tanner, Wilson\\r\\nand Swets (1954)].\"]\n"

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question about the PatchTST algorithm. Let me start by recalling what I know about time series prediction algorithms, especially deep learning ones. The user is asking for specific details on PatchTST and how it differs from others. They also want examples, future works, and a comparison with other deep learning methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should probably look up the PatchTST paper to get exact details. From what I remember, PatchTST stands for \"Patch Transformer for Time Series Prediction.\" It's designed to handle time series data by transforming it into patches or segments that can be processed using transformer models, which are commonly used in NLP tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key idea is breaking down the time series into overlapping patches. Each patch captures local information around a specific point in time. This allows the model to capture both local and global patterns, which is useful for forecasting. The patches are then fed into a transformer, which can model long-range dependencies better than traditional RNNs or LSTMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically, each time series is represented as X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n], where n is the length of the series. Patches would be overlapping windows of size m, so for each position i in 1 to n-m+1, we have a patch P_i = [x_i, x_{i+1}, ..., x_{i+m-1}]. The transformer then processes these patches to predict future values.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should compare this with other deep learning models. For example, traditional RNNs process data sequentially and have difficulty capturing long-range dependencies. LSTMs help a bit by remembering longer sequences but still might not capture all necessary patterns. Attention mechanisms in models like Transformer or attention-based models can help, but PatchTST seems to take it further by explicitly creating patches for better local and global context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors probably provide examples where they apply PatchTST to real-world datasets, maybe something like stock prices or weather forecasting. They might show that their model outperforms others on these tasks due to its ability to capture both local trends and broader patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "For future works, the authors might suggest extending the model with more sophisticated attention mechanisms, incorporating external knowledge, or adapting it for multivariate time series where multiple features are involved. They could also explore different patch sizes or structures to improve performance further.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure to include mathematical notations as much as possible, like defining patches and how they're processed through a transformer layer. Also, I need to avoid making up details and stick to what's in the paper, so if I'm unsure about something, I might have to note that or refer to specific sections of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also think about how PatchTST is different from other deep learning methods. It's not just another transformer; it specifically uses patches for time series data. This structural approach allows it to handle the unique challenges of time series prediction more effectively than standard models.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might need to explain technical aspects like self-attention in the context of patches, how positional encoding works for time series, and maybe even touch on hyperparameters or training considerations specific to PatchTST.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I should structure my answer by first defining what a Patch is, then explaining the algorithm step-by-step, comparing it with other methods, providing examples from the paper, discussing future works as mentioned, and using mathematical notation where appropriate.\n",
