      "RAG (Recurrent Attention Graph) is a method used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate text by attending to the context of a sentence. The idea behind RAG is to model the interplay between the sentence and its surrounding context in a graphical way. The attention mechanism is used to selectively focus on the relevant parts of the graph based on the sentence context. The resulting graph is used to generate the output text by using the selected words or phrases as the starting point for the generation process. RAG has been used successfully in various NLP applications, including machine translation, summarization, and text classification.\n"

As most existing graph representation learning methods cannot efficiently handle both these characteristics, we propose a Transformer-like model, named THAN, to learn low-dimensional node embeddings preserving topological structure features, semantics, dynamic patterns temporal graphs, simultaneously. Specifically, THAN first samples neighbors with constraints projects features into same vector space, then encodes time information aggregates neighborhood influence different weights via type-aware self-attention.

These forecasters leverage Transformers to model global dependencies over temporal tokens time series, with each token formed by multiple variates same timestamp.

Besides, embedding fuses that represent potential delayed events distinct physical measurements, which may fail learning variate-centric representations result meaningless attention maps.

Despite growing performance over past few years, we question validity this line research in work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably most successful solution to extract semantic correlations among elements long sequence. However, modeling, are temporal relations an ordered set continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens embed sub-series facilitate preserving some ordering information, nature permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results information loss. To validate our claim, introduce embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear comparison. Experimental on nine real-life datasets show that surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated LTSF all cases, often by large margin. Moreover, conduct comprehensive empirical studies explore impacts various design their relation extraction capability. We hope surprising finding opens up new directions also advocate revisiting other analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) future.\n",
