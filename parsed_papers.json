To tackle such issues, we propose novel Transformer-based model for multivariate forecasting, called spatial-temporal convolutional Transformer network (STCTN). STCTN mainly consists attention mechanisms respectively Local-range mechanism is proposed in simultaneously focus on both global at sequence level, which addresses first shortcoming.

        "abstract": "In order to answer semantically-complicated questions about an image, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model needs fully understand the visual scene in especially interactive dynamics between different objects. We propose Relation-aware Graph Attention Network (ReGAT), which encodes each image into graph and models multi-type inter-object relations via attention mechanism, learn question-adaptive relation representations. Two types of object are explored: (i) Explicit Relations that represent geometric positions semantic interactions objects; (ii) Implicit capture hidden regions. Experiments demonstrate ReGAT outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on both VQA 2.0 VQA-CP v2 datasets. further show is compatible existing architectures, can be used as generic encoder boost performance for VQA.",

Specifically, THAN first samples neighbors with constraints projects features into same vector space, then encodes time information aggregates neighborhood influence different weights via type-aware self-attention.
